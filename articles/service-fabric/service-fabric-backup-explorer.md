# Read and Update your Reliable Collections Backup using Service Fabric Backup Explorer

> [!NOTE]
> Service Fabric Backup Explorer currently only supports viewing and editing Reliable Dictionaries in the Backup.
>

Service Fabric Backup Explorer helps in data correction in case of data corruption in Service Fabric Reliable Collections. The current state of data can be corrupted because of any bug introduced in application or any wrong entries made in the live clusters.
With the help of Backup Explorer following tasks can be performed :
-	Querying of metadata for the collection.
-	View current state and its entries in the collection of the backup loaded.
-	Enlist the transactions performed (since the last checkpoint).
-	Update the collection by adding, updating or deleting the entries in the collection.
-	Take a fresh backup with the updated state.

The Service Fabric Backup Explorer can be consumed in any of the following ways for view/update of reliable collections of the backup.
-	Binary - Nuget package to view and alter the reliable collections.
-	HTTP/Rest - HTTP based Rest Server to view and alter the reliable collections.
-	bkpctl - Service fabric backup Explorer CLI (command line interface) to view and alter the reliable collections.

As part of artifacts it has a C# library for advanced user which can be used in the application directly to work with reliable collections pretty much in the same way customers work with the state manager in their existing stateful services. For simple users and basic use case, it also has a standalone REST Server exposing  APIs to inspects the backups. There is a bkpctl CLI tool on top of the rest APIs, based on python to read/update and take backups via command line.
