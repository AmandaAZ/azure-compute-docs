# Service Fabric application and service security

## Secure the hosting environment
By using Azure Service Fabric, you can secure applications that are running in the cluster under different user accounts. Service Fabric also helps secure the resources that are used by applications at the time of deployment under the user accounts--for example, files, directories, and certificates. This makes running applications, even in a shared hosted environment, more secure from one another.

The application manifest declares the security principals (users and groups) required run the service(s) and secure resources.  These security principals are referenced in policies, for example the RunAs, endpoint binding, package sharing, or security access policies.  Policies are then applied to service resources in the **ServiceManifestImport** section of the application manifest.

When declaring principals, you can also define and create user groups so that one or more users can be added to each group to be managed together. This is useful when there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level.

By default, Service Fabric applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Service Fabric also provides the capability to run applications under a local user account or local system account, which is specified within the application manifest. For more information, see [Run a service as a local user account or local system account](service-fabric-application-runas-security.md).  You can also [Run a service startup script as a local user or system account](service-fabric-run-script-at-service-startup.md).

When you're running Service Fabric on a Windows standalone cluster, you can run a service under [Active Directory domain accounts](service-fabric-run-service-as-ad-user-or-group.md) or [group managed service accounts](service-fabric-run-service-as-gmsa.md).

## Manage secrets
Secrets can be any sensitive information, such as storage connection strings, passwords, or other values that should not be handled in plain text. This article uses Azure Key Vault to manage keys and secrets. However, *using* secrets in an application is cloud platform-agnostic to allow applications to be deployed to a cluster hosted anywhere.

The recommended way to manage service configuration settings is through [service configuration packages][config-package]. Configuration packages are versioned and updatable through managed rolling upgrades with health-validation and auto rollback. This is preferred to global configuration as it reduces the chances of a global service outage. Encrypted secrets are no exception. Service Fabric has built-in features for encrypting and decrypting values in a configuration package Settings.xml file using certificate encryption.

The following diagram illustrates the basic flow for secret management in a Service Fabric application:

![secret management overview][overview]

There are four main steps in this flow:

1. Obtain a data encipherment certificate.
2. Install the certificate in your cluster.
3. Encrypt secret values when deploying an application with the certificate and inject them into a service's Settings.xml configuration file.
4. Read encrypted values out of Settings.xml by decrypting with the same encipherment certificate. 

[Azure Key Vault][key-vault-get-started] is used here as a safe storage location for certificates and as a way to get certificates installed on Service Fabric clusters in Azure. If you are not deploying to Azure, you do not need to use Key Vault to manage secrets in Service Fabric applications.

For an example, see [Manage application secrets](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md).

## Secure containers
Service Fabric provides a mechanism for services inside a container to access a certificate that is installed on the nodes in a Windows or Linux cluster (version 5.7 or higher). This PFX certificate can be used for authenticating the application or service or secure communication with other services. For more information, see [Import a certificate into a container](service-fabric-securing-containers.md).

In addition, Service Fabric also supports gMSA (group Managed Service Accounts) for Windows containers. For more information, see [Set up gMSA for Windows containers](service-fabric-setup-gmsa-for-windows-containers.md).

## Secure service communication
TO DO: Use HTTPS (ASP.NET Core, Java)

You can establish secure connection between the reverse proxy and services, thus enabling an end to end secure channel. Connecting to secure services is supported only when reverse proxy is configured to listen on HTTPS. For information on configuring the reverse proxy, read [Reverse proxy in Azure Service Fabric](service-fabric-reverseproxy.md).  [Connect to a secure service](service-fabric-reverseproxy-configure-secure-communication.md) describes how to establish secure connection between the reverse proxy and services.

The Reliable Services application framework provides a few prebuilt communication stacks and tools that you can use to improve security. Learn how to improve security when you're using service remoting (in [C#](service-fabric-reliable-services-secure-communication.md) or [Java](service-fabric-reliable-services-secure-communication-java.md)) or using [WCF](service-fabric-reliable-services-secure-communication-wcf.md).

## Restrict and secure access to your services using an API gateway
Cloud applications typically need a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. In Service Fabric, a gateway can be any stateless service such as an [ASP.NET Core application](service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-aspnetcore.md), or another service designed for traffic ingress, such as [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/), [IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/), or [Azure API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/api-management).

API Management integrates directly with Service Fabric, allowing you to publish APIs with a rich set of routing rules to your back-end Service Fabric services.  You can by secure access to backend services, prevent DOS attacks by using throttling, or verify API keys, JWT tokens, certificates, and other credentials. To learn more, read [Service Fabric with Azure API Management overview](service-fabric-api-management-overview.md).

## Encrypt application data at rest
Each [node type](service-fabric-cluster-nodetypes.md) in a Service Fabric cluster running in Azure is backed by a [virtual machine scale set](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview.md). Using a Azure Resource Manager template, you can attach data disks to the scale set(s) that make up the Service Fabric cluster.  If your services save data to attached data disk, you can [encrypt those data disks](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-encrypt-disks-ps.md).

TO DO: Enable BitLocker on Windows standalone clusters?
TO DO: Encrypt disks on Linux clusters?

## TO DO: Service-to-service authentication and authorization
