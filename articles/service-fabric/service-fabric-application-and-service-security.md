# Service Fabric application and service security

## Secure the hosting environment
By using Azure Service Fabric, you can secure applications that are running in the cluster under different user accounts. Service Fabric also helps secure the resources that are used by applications at the time of deployment under the user accounts--for example, files, directories, and certificates. This makes running applications, even in a shared hosted environment, more secure from one another.

By default, Service Fabric applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Service Fabric also provides the capability to run applications under a local user account or local system account, which is specified within the application manifest. Supported local system account types are **LocalUser**, **NetworkService**, **LocalService**, and **LocalSystem**.

 When you're running Service Fabric on Windows Server in your datacenter by using the standalone installer, you can use Active Directory domain accounts, including group managed service accounts.

You can define and create user groups so that one or more users can be added to each group to be managed together. This is useful when there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level.

For an example, see [Run setup scripts at service startup](service-fabric-run-script-at-service-startup.md).

## Manage secrets
Secrets can be any sensitive information, such as storage connection strings, passwords, or other values that should not be handled in plain text. This article uses Azure Key Vault to manage keys and secrets. However, *using* secrets in an application is cloud platform-agnostic to allow applications to be deployed to a cluster hosted anywhere.

The recommended way to manage service configuration settings is through [service configuration packages][config-package]. Configuration packages are versioned and updatable through managed rolling upgrades with health-validation and auto rollback. This is preferred to global configuration as it reduces the chances of a global service outage. Encrypted secrets are no exception. Service Fabric has built-in features for encrypting and decrypting values in a configuration package Settings.xml file using certificate encryption.

The following diagram illustrates the basic flow for secret management in a Service Fabric application:

![secret management overview][overview]

There are four main steps in this flow:

1. Obtain a data encipherment certificate.
2. Install the certificate in your cluster.
3. Encrypt secret values when deploying an application with the certificate and inject them into a service's Settings.xml configuration file.
4. Read encrypted values out of Settings.xml by decrypting with the same encipherment certificate. 

[Azure Key Vault][key-vault-get-started] is used here as a safe storage location for certificates and as a way to get certificates installed on Service Fabric clusters in Azure. If you are not deploying to Azure, you do not need to use Key Vault to manage secrets in Service Fabric applications.

For an example, see [Manage application secrets](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md).

## Secure service communication
Use HTTPS (ASP.NET Core, Java)

You can establish secure connection between the reverse proxy and services, thus enabling an end to end secure channel.
Connecting to secure services is supported only when reverse proxy is configured to listen on HTTPS. For information on configuring the reverse proxy, read [Reverse proxy in Azure Service Fabric](service-fabric-reverseproxy.md).  [Connect to a secure service](service-fabric-reverseproxy-configure-secure-communication.md) describes how to establish secure connection between the reverse proxy and services.

The Reliable Services application framework provides a few prebuilt communication stacks and tools that you can use to improve security. Learn how to improve security when you're using service remoting in [C#](service-fabric-reliable-services-secure-communication.md) or [Java](service-fabric-reliable-services-secure-communication-java.md).

## Restrict access to your services using an API gateway
Cloud applications typically need a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. In Service Fabric, a gateway can be any stateless service such as an [ASP.NET Core application](service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-aspnetcore.md), or another service designed for traffic ingress, such as [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/), [IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/), or [Azure API Management](service-fabric-api-management-overview.md).

## Encrypt application data at rest
Each [node type](service-fabric-cluster-nodetypes.md) in a Service Fabric cluster running in Azure is backed by a [virtual machine scale set](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview.md). Using a Azure Resource Manager template, you can attach data disks to the scale set(s) that make up the Service Fabric cluster.  If your services save data to attached data disk, you can [encrypt those data disks](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-encrypt-disks-ps.md).

Enable BitLocker on Windows standalone clusters?
Encrypt disks on Linux clusters?
