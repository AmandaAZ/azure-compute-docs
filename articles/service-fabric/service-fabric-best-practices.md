# Azure Service Fabric Application and Cluster Best Practices
To manage Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters successfully, there are operations that we highly recommend you perform, to optimize for the reliability of your production environment; please perform operations defined in this document, and select one of our [Azure Samples Service Fabric Cluster templates](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-cluster-templates) to begin achitecting your production solution or modify your existing template to incorporate these practices.

## Security 
For more information about [Azure Security Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/) please check out [Azure Service Fabric security best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-service-fabric-security-best-practices)
### KeyVault
[Azure KeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) is the recommended secrets management service for Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters.
> [!NOTE]
> Azure KeyVault and compute resources must be co-located in the same region.  

### Provision Your Service Fabric Cluster Custom Domain Certificate
The following is the Portal Blade where you can provide the credentials for a KeyVault integrated CA to provsion your custom domain certificate:
```bash
https://ms.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<YOUR VAULT>/certificates
```

### Reliably Deploy KeyVault Certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets

Virtual Machine Scale Set [osProfile](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/createorupdate#virtualmachinescalesetosprofile) is how you reliably deploy KeyVault certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and the following is the Resource Manager template properties that you will declare: 
```json
"secrets": [
   {
       "sourceVault": {
           "id": "[parameters('sourceVaultValue')]"
       },
       "vaultCertificates": [
          {
              "certificateStore": "[parameters('certificateStoreValue')]",
              "certificateUrl": "[parameters('certificateUrlValue')]"
          }
       ]
   }
]
```
### Service Fabric Cluster Common Name Certificate
### ACL Certificate to your Service Fabric Cluster
[Virtual Machine Scale Set extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss/extension?view=azure-cli-latest) publisher   Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric is how you ACL certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster, and the following is the Resource Manager template properties that you will declare:
```json
"certificate": {
   "commonNames": [
       "[parameters('certificateCommonName')]"
   ],
   "x509StoreName": "[parameters('certificateStoreValue')]"
}
```
### Configure Custom Domain Service Fabric Cluster Certificate
Service Fabric Cluster [certificateCommonNames](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/servicefabric/sfrp-model-clusterproperties#certificatecommonnames) Resource Manager template property, is how you configure the custom domain common name property of your valid certificate, and the following is the Resource Manager template properties that you will declare:
```json
"certificateCommonNames": {
    "commonNames": [
        {
            "certificateCommonName": "[parameters('certificateCommonName')]",
            "certificateIssuerThumbprint": "[parameters('certificateIssuerThumbprint')]"
        }
    ],
    "x509StoreName": "[parameters('certificateStoreValue')]"
}
```
Your Service Fabric cluster will use your valid trusted installed certificate, that you declared by common name, which expires further into the future; when more than one valid certificate is installed on your Virtual Machine Scale Sets ceritifcate store.

Given you can not provision certificates for Microsoft domains, such as *\<YOUR SUBDOMAIN\>.cloudapp.azure.com or \<YOUR SUBDOMAIN\>.trafficmanager.net, from KeyVault integrated 3rd Party Certificate Authorities; you must provision and configure [Azure DNS to host your domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns). After delegating your domains name servers to your Azure DNS zone name servers, you will need to add the following 2 Records Set to you DNS Zone:'A' record for domain APEX that is NOT a "Alias record set" to all IP Addresses your custom domain will resolve, and a 'C' record for Microsoft Subdomain you provisioned  that is NOT a "Alias record set" (E.G. Use your Traffic Manager or Load Balancer's DNS name).

You should also update your Service Fabric Cluster "managementEndpoint" Resource Manager template property to your custom domain, so that portal can display the correct url to connnect to your Service Fabric Explorer User Interface, and the follow is the snippet of the property you will update to your custom domain:
```json
 "managementEndpoint": "[concat('https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>:',parameters('nt0fabricHttpGatewayPort'))]",
```
### Encrypting Secret Values 
To [set up an encryption certificate and encrypt secrets on Windows clusters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-secret-management-windows):

Generate a self signed certificate for encrypting your secret using the following:
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type DocumentEncryptionCert -KeyUsage DataEncipherment -Subject mydataenciphermentcert -Provider 'Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0'
```
Use the Reliably Deploy KeyVault Certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets instructions in this document to deploy/install your certificate.

Encrypt your secret using the following, and update your Service Fabric Application Manifest with the encrypted value:
``` powershell
Invoke-ServiceFabricEncryptText -CertStore -CertThumbprint "<thumbprint>" -Text "mysecret" -StoreLocation CurrentUser -StoreName My
```
To [set up an encryption certificate and encrypt secrets on Linux clusters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-secret-management-linux):

Generate a self signed certificate for encrypting your secrets using the following:
```bash
user@linux:~$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout TestCert.prv -x509 -days 365 -out TestCert.pem
user@linux:~$ cat TestCert.prv >> TestCert.pem
```
Use the Reliably Deploy KeyVault Certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets instructions in this document to deploy/install your certificate.

Encrypt your secret using the following, and update your Service Fabric Application Manifest with the encrypted value:
```bash
user@linux:$ echo "Hello World!" > plaintext.txt
user@linux:$ iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-16LE plaintext.txt -o plaintext_UTF-16.txt
user@linux:$ openssl smime -encrypt -in plaintext_UTF-16.txt -binary -outform der TestCert.pem | base64 > encrypted.txt
```

### Azure Active Directory (AAD) for client identity
-- ARM properties for enabling AAD
### Compute Managed Service Identity (MSI)
[Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-does-it-work).

To [enable system-assigned managed identity during the creation of a virtual machines scale set or an existing virtual machines scale set](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-template-windows-vmss#system-assigned-managed-identity), declare the following Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachinesScaleSets" property:

```json
"identity": { 
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
```

If you created a  [user-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-arm#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity), declare the following resource in your template to assign it to your virtual machine scale set, and replace \<USERASSIGNEDIDENTITYNAME\> with the name of the user-assigned managed identity you created:
```json
"identity": {
    "type": "userAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "[resourceID('Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/',variables('<USERASSIGNEDIDENTITYNAME>'))]": {}
    }
}
```

Before your Service Fabric Application can make use of a managed identity, it need have permissions granted to the Azure Resources it needs to authenticate with, and the follow are the commands to grant access to an Azure Resource:

```bash
principalid=$(az resource show --id /subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTON>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/<YOUR SCALE SET> --api-version 2018-06-01 | python -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['identity']['principalId'])")

az role assignment create --assignee $principalid --role 'Contributor' --scope "/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/<PROVIDER NAME>/<RESOURCE TYPE>/<RESOURCE NAME>"
```

In your Service Fabric Application Code obtain an access token for ARM by making a rest call that will be similar to the following:

```bash
access_token=$(curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F' -H Metadata:true | python -c "import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token']")

```

Your Service Fabric Application can then use the access token to authenticate to Azure Resources that support Active Directory, and the followinig is an example of how to do this for cosmos db resource:
```bash
cosmos_db_password=$(curl 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/<YOUR ACCOUNT>/listKeys?api-version=2016-03-31' -X POST -d "" -H "Authorization: Bearer $access_token" | python -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['primaryMasterKey'])")
```
### Security Policies
-- XML manifest for run as 
### Windows Defender 
"[By default](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-2016), Windows Defender Antimalware is installed and functional on Windows Server 2016. The user interface is installed by default on some SKUs, but is not required." Given the performance impact and resource consumption overhead, if you security policies allow you to exclude processes and paths for open source software, then you will declare the following Virtual Machine Scale Set Extension Resource Manager template properties:

```json
 {
    "name": "[concat('VMIaaSAntimalware','_vmNodeType0Name')]",
    "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Security",
        "type": "IaaSAntimalware",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.5",
        "settings": {
            "AntimalwareEnabled": "true",
            "Exclusions": {
                "Paths": "[concat(parameters('svcFabData'), ';', parameters('svcFabLogs'), ';', parameters('svcFabRuntime'))]",
                "Processes": "Fabric.exe;FabricHost.exe;FabricInstallerService.exe;FabricSetup.exe;FabricDeployer.exe;ImageBuilder.exe;FabricGateway.exe;FabricDCA.exe;FabricFAS.exe;FabricUOS.exe;FabricRM.exe;FileStoreService.exe"
            },
            "RealtimeProtectionEnabled": "true",
            "ScheduledScanSettings": {
                "isEnabled": "true",
                "scanType": "Quick",
                "day": "7",
                "time": "120"
            }
        },
        "protectedSettings": null
    }
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> Please refer to your Antimalware documentation for configuring rules if not using Windows Defender; Windows Defender isn't supported on none windows Operating System distributions.

## Capacity Planning and Scaling
Before creating any Azure Service Fabric cluster it is important to [plan for capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity) by considering many items during the process.
* The number of node types your cluster needs to start out with
* The properties of each of node type (size, primary, internet facing, number of VMs, etc.)
* The reliability and durability characteristics of the cluster

> [!NOTE]
> Scaling compute resources to source your application work load requires intentional planning, will nearly always take longer than an hour to complete for a production environment

### Vertical 
[Vertical scaling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/virtual-machine-scale-set-scale-node-type-scale-out#upgrade-the-size-and-operating-system-of-the-primary-node-type-vms) of a Node Type in Azure Service Fabric requires a number of steps and considerations that must be taken. 
* The cluster must be healthy before scaling, otherwise you will only destabilize cluster further.
* **Silver durability level or greater** is required for all Service Fabric Cluster NodeTypes that are hosting stateful services.

> [!NOTE]
> Your primary NodeType that is hosting Stateful Service Fabric System Services, and must be Silver durability level or greater.

Given inplace vertical scaling of a Virtual Machine Scale Set is a destructive operation, you have to horizontally scale your cluster by adding a new Scale Set with the desires SKU, and migrate your services to your desired SKU to complete a safe vertical scaling operation. Service Fabric [node properties and placement constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-cluster-description#node-properties-and-placement-constraints) are leveraged by your cluster to decide where to host your Applications services; so when vertically scaling your Primary Node Type, declaring indentical property values for "nodeTypeRef" Virtual Machine Scale Set Service Fabric Extension, enables your cluster to choose an your provisioned scale set with those properties to host your Applications services. The following is a snippet of the Resource Manager template properties you will declare, with the same value for your new provisioned scale sets that you are scaling to, and is only supported as a temporary stateful for your cluster:
```json
"settings": {
   "nodeTypeRef": ["[parameters('vmNodeType0Name')]"]
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> Do not leave your cluster with multiple scale sets using the same nodeTypeRef property value longer than required to complete a successful vertical scaling operation, and you should always validate operations in test environments before attempting production environment changes. By default Service Fabric Cluster System Services have a placement constraint to target primary nodetype only.

With your node properties and placement constraints declared, you need to execute the following steps one VM instance at a time. This allows for the system services (and your stateful services) to be shut down gracefully on the VM instance you are removing and new replicas created else where.
1. Run Disable-ServiceFabricNode with intent ‘RemoveNode’ to disable the node you’re going to remove (the highest instance in that node type).
2. Run Get-ServiceFabricNode to make sure that the node has indeed transitioned to disabled. If not, wait until the node is disabled. You cannot hurry this step.
3. Change the number of VMs by one in that Node type. This will now remove the highest VM instance.
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 as needed, but never scale down the number of instances in the primary node types less than what the reliability tier warrants. Refer to the details on reliability tiers here.

### Horizontal Scaling 
Horizontal Scaling in Service Fabric can be done either [maunally](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-scale-up-down) or [programmatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-programmatic-scaling).
#### Scaling Out
Scaling out of a Service Fabric cluster can simply be done by increasing the instance count for a particular VMSS. You can scale out programmatically by using the AzureClient and the id for the desired scale set to increase the capacity.
```c#
var scaleSet = AzureClient.VirtualMachineScaleSets.GetById(ScaleSetId);
var newCapacity = (int)Math.Min(MaximumNodeCount, scaleSet.Capacity + 1);
scaleSet.Update().WithCapacity(newCapacity).Apply(); 
```
To scale out manually you can update the capactity in the SKU property of the desired [Virtual Machine Scale Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/createorupdate#virtualmachinescalesetosprofile) resource.
```json
"sku": {
    "name": "[parameters('vmNodeType0Size')]",
    "capacity": "[parameters('nt0InstanceCount')]",
    "tier": "Standard"
}
```
#### Scaling In
Scaling In requires more consideration than scaling out. 
* The service fabric system services run in the Primary node type in your cluster. So should never shut down or scale down the number of instances in that node types less than what the reliability tier warrants. 
* For a stateful service, you need a certain number of nodes to be always up to maintain availability and preserve state of your service. At the very minimum, you need the number of nodes equal to the target replica set count of the partition/service.

To scale in manually requires the completion of the following steps:
1. Run [Disable-ServiceFabricNode](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/servicefabric/disable-servicefabricnode?view=azureservicefabricps) with intent ‘RemoveNode’ to disable the node you’re going to remove (the highest instance in that node type).
2. Run [Get-ServiceFabricNode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/servicefabric/get-servicefabricnode?view=azureservicefabricps) to make sure that the node has indeed transitioned to disabled. If not, wait until the node is disabled. You cannot hurry this step.
3. Decrease the instance count to the desired number of nodes in the SKU property of the desired [Virtual Machine Scale Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/createorupdate#virtualmachinescalesetosprofile) resource.
```json
"sku": {
    "name": "[parameters('vmNodeType0Size')]",
    "capacity": "[parameters('nt0InstanceCount')]",
    "tier": "Standard"
}
```
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 as needed, but never scale down the number of instances in the primary node types less than what the reliability tier warrants. Refer to the [details on reliability tiers here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity).

To scale in programatically requires preparing the node for shutdown involves finding the node to be removed (the most recently added virtual machine scale set instance) and deactivating it. 
```c#
using (var client = new FabricClient())
{
    var mostRecentLiveNode = (await client.QueryManager.GetNodeListAsync())
        .Where(n => n.NodeType.Equals(NodeTypeToScale, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        .Where(n => n.NodeStatus == System.Fabric.Query.NodeStatus.Up)
        .OrderByDescending(n =>
        {
            var instanceIdIndex = n.NodeName.LastIndexOf("_");
            var instanceIdString = n.NodeName.Substring(instanceIdIndex + 1);
            return int.Parse(instanceIdString);
        })
        .FirstOrDefault();
```

Once the node to be removed is found, it can be deactivated and removed using the same FabricClient instance and the IAzure instance from earlier.
```c#
var scaleSet = AzureClient.VirtualMachineScaleSets.GetById(ScaleSetId);

// Remove the node from the Service Fabric cluster
ServiceEventSource.Current.ServiceMessage(Context, $"Disabling node {mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName}");
await client.ClusterManager.DeactivateNodeAsync(mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName, NodeDeactivationIntent.RemoveNode);

// Wait (up to a timeout) for the node to gracefully shutdown
var timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
var waitStart = DateTime.Now;
while ((mostRecentLiveNode.NodeStatus == System.Fabric.Query.NodeStatus.Up || mostRecentLiveNode.NodeStatus == System.Fabric.Query.NodeStatus.Disabling) &&
        DateTime.Now - waitStart < timeout)
{
    mostRecentLiveNode = (await client.QueryManager.GetNodeListAsync()).FirstOrDefault(n => n.NodeName == mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName);
    await Task.Delay(10 * 1000);
}

// Decrement VMSS capacity
var newCapacity = (int)Math.Max(MinimumNodeCount, scaleSet.Capacity - 1); // Check min count 

scaleSet.Update().WithCapacity(newCapacity).Apply();
```

### Reliability Levels
The [reliability level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity) is a property of your Service Fabric Cluster resource, and can not be configured differently for individual nodeTypes. It controls the replication factor of the system services for the cluster, and is a setting at the cluster resource level. The reliability level will determine the minimum number of nodes that your primary node type must have. The reliability tier can take the following values:
* Platinum - Run the System services with a target replica set count of seven
* Gold - Run the System services with a target replica set count of seven
* Silver - Run the System services with a target replica set count of five
* Bronze - Run the System services with a target replica set count of three
The minimum recommened reliability level is Silver.

The reliability level is set in the properties section of the [Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.servicefabric/2018-02-01/clusters)
```json
"properties":{
    "reliabilityLevel": "Silver"
}
```
### Durability Levels
> [!WARNING]
> Node types running with Bronze durability obtain _no privileges_. This means that infrastructure jobs that impact your stateless workloads will not be stopped or delayed, which might impact your workloads. Use only Bronze for node types that run only stateless workloads. For production workloads, running Silver or above is recommended. 

The durability level must be set in two resources. The extension profile of the [Virtual Machine Scale Set resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/createorupdate#virtualmachinescalesetosprofile).
```json
"extensionProfile": {
    "extensions":          {
        "name": "[concat('ServiceFabricNodeVmExt','_vmNodeType0Name')]",
        "properties": {
            "settings": {
                "durabilityLevel": "Bronze"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
And under the nodeType in the [Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.servicefabric/2018-02-01/clusters) 
```json
"nodeTypes": [
    {
        "name": "[variables('vmNodeType0Name')]",
        "durabilityLevel": "Bronze"
    }
]
```
## Infrastructure as Code 
-- Sample repo link and API documentation. Modify these samples for these needs.
-- Portal should not be used to provision a production ready cluster.
-- deployment using AZ CLI and Powershell
-- The create SF powershell cmdlet should only be used for dev test
### Service Fabric ARM Resources 
-- JSON Snippet of the types of SF 
-- Cluster, Application, Application Version, Application Type, Service Version, Service Type
-- Link to packaging, explicity put Zip File create from directory. Need to do this to use this resource type. If you are on Linux use a different ZIP file utility. Put the Python snippet.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics
[Monitoring and diagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-overview) are critical to developing, testing, and deploying workloads in any cloud environment. For example, you can track how your applications are used, the actions taken by the Service Fabric platform, your resource utilization with performance counters, and the overall health of your cluster. You can use this information to diagnose and correct issues, and prevent them from occurring in the future.
### Application Monitoring
Application monitoring tracks how features and components of your application are being used. You want to monitor your applications to make sure issues that impact users are caught. The responsibility of application monitoring is on the users developing an application and its services since it is unique to the business logic of your application. It is recommended that you set up application monitoring with [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-monitoring-aspnet).
### Cluster Monitoring
One of Service Fabric's goals is to keep applications resilient to hardware failures. This goal is achieved through the platform's system services' ability to detect infrastructure issues and rapidly failover workloads to other nodes in the cluster. But in this particular case, what if the system services themselves have issues? Or if in attempting to deploy or move a workload, rules for the placement of services are violated? Service Fabric provides diagnostics for these and more to make sure you are informed about activity taking place in your cluster. It is recommended that you set up cluster monitoring with [Diagnostics Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-aggregation-wad) and [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-setup).
### Infrastructure Monitoring
[Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-agent) is our recommendation to monitor cluster level events.
