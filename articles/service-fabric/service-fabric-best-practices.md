## Azure Service Fabric Application and Cluster Best Practices
To manage Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters successfully, there are operations that we highly recommend you perform, to optimize for the reliability of your production environment.

## Security 
For more information about [Azure Security Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/) please check out [Azure Service Fabric security best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-service-fabric-security-best-practices)
### KeyVault
[Azure KeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) is the recommended secrets management service for Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters.
> [!NOTE]
> Azure KeyVault and compute resources must be co-located in the same region.  

The following is the Portal Blade where you can provide the credentials for a KeyVault integrated CA to provsion your custom domain certificate:

-- TODO: Add Portal Blade Common Name Cert Generation

Portal Blade for Keyvault certificates:
```bash
https://ms.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<YOUR VAULT>/certificates
```

#### Reliably Deploy KeyVault Certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets
Virtual Machine Scale Set [osProfile](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/createorupdate#virtualmachinescalesetosprofile) is how you reliably deploy KeyVault certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and the following is the Resource Manager template properties that you will declare: 
```json
"secrets": [
   {
       "sourceVault": {
           "id": "[parameters('sourceVaultValue')]"
       },
       "vaultCertificates": [
          {
              "certificateStore": "[parameters('certificateStoreValue')]",
              "certificateUrl": "[parameters('certificateUrlValue')]"
          }
       ]
   }
]
```
### Service Fabric Cluster Common Name Certificate
#### ACL Certificate to your Service Fabric Cluster
[Virtual Machine Scale Set extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vmss/extension?view=azure-cli-latest) publisher   Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric is how you ACL certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster, and the following is the Resource Manager template properties that you will declare:
```json
"certificate": {
   "commonNames": [
       "[parameters('certificateCommonName')]"
   ],
   "x509StoreName": "[parameters('certificateStoreValue')]"
}
```
#### Configure Custom Domain Service Fabric Cluster Certificate
Service Fabric Cluster [certificateCommonNames](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/servicefabric/sfrp-model-clusterproperties#certificatecommonnames) Resource Manager template property, is how you configure the custom domain common name property of your valid certificate, and the following is the Resource Manager template properties that you will declare:
```json
"certificateCommonNames": {
    "commonNames": [
        {
            "certificateCommonName": "[parameters('certificateCommonName')]",
            "certificateIssuerThumbprint": "[parameters('certificateIssuerThumbprint')]"
        }
    ],
    "x509StoreName": "[parameters('certificateStoreValue')]"
}
```
Your Service Fabric cluster will use your valid trusted installed certificate, that you declared by common name, which expires further into the future; when more than one valid certificate is installed on your Virtual Machine Scale Sets ceritifcate store.

Given you can not provision certificates for Microsoft domains, such as *\<YOUR SUBDOMAIN\>.cloudapp.azure.com or \<YOUR SUBDOMAIN\>.trafficmanager.net, from KeyVault integrated 3rd Party Certificate Authorities; you must provision and configure [Azure DNS to host your domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns). After delegating your domains name servers to your Azure DNS zone name servers, you will need to add the following 2 Records Set to you DNS Zone:'A' record for domain APEX that is NOT a "Alias record set" to all IP Addresses your custom domain will resolve, and a 'C' record for Microsoft Subdomain you provisioned  that is NOT a "Alias record set" (E.G. Use your Traffic Manager or Load Balancer's DNS name).

You should also update your Service Fabric Cluster "managementEndpoint" Resource Manager template property to your custom domain, so that portal can display the correct url to connnect to your Service Fabric Explorer User Interface, and the follow is the snippet of the property you will update to your custom domain:
```json
 "managementEndpoint": "[concat('https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>:',parameters('nt0fabricHttpGatewayPort'))]",
```
### Encrypting Secret Values 
To [set up an encryption certificate and encrypt secrets on Windows clusters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-secret-management-windows):

Generate a self signed certificate for encrypting your secret using the following:
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type DocumentEncryptionCert -KeyUsage DataEncipherment -Subject mydataenciphermentcert -Provider 'Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0'
```
Use the Reliably Deploy KeyVault Certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets instructions in this document to deploy/install your certificate.

Encrypt your secret using the following, and update your Service Fabric Application Manifest with the encrypted value:
``` powershell
Invoke-ServiceFabricEncryptText -CertStore -CertThumbprint "<thumbprint>" -Text "mysecret" -StoreLocation CurrentUser -StoreName My
```
To [set up an encryption certificate and encrypt secrets on Linux clusters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-secret-management-linux):

Generate a self signed certificate for encrypting your secrets using the following:
```bash
user@linux:~$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout TestCert.prv -x509 -days 365 -out TestCert.pem
user@linux:~$ cat TestCert.prv >> TestCert.pem
```
Use the Reliably Deploy KeyVault Certificates to your Service Fabric Cluster's Virtual Machine Scale Sets instructions in this document to deploy/install your certificate.

Encrypt your secret using the following, and update your Service Fabric Application Manifest with the encrypted value:
```bash
user@linux:$ echo "Hello World!" > plaintext.txt
user@linux:$ iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-16LE plaintext.txt -o plaintext_UTF-16.txt
user@linux:$ openssl smime -encrypt -in plaintext_UTF-16.txt -binary -outform der TestCert.pem | base64 > encrypted.txt
```

### Azure Active Directory (AAD) for client identity
-- ARM properties for enabling AAD
### Compute Managed Service Identity (MSI)
[Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-does-it-work).

To [enable system-assigned managed identity during the creation of a virtual machines scale set or an existing virtual machines scale set](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-template-windows-vmss#system-assigned-managed-identity), declare the following Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachinesScaleSets" property:

```json
"identity": { 
    "type": "SystemAssigned"
}
```

If you created a  [user-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-arm#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity), declare the following resource in your template to assign it to your virtual machine scale set, and replace \<USERASSIGNEDIDENTITYNAME\> with the name of the user-assigned managed identity you created:
```json
"identity": {
    "type": "userAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {
        "[resourceID('Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/',variables('<USERASSIGNEDIDENTITYNAME>'))]": {}
    }
}
```

Before your Service Fabric Application can make use of a managed identity, it need have permissions granted to the Azure Resources it needs to authenticate with, and the follow are the commands to grant access to an Azure Resource:

```bash
principalid=$(az resource show --id /subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTON>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/<YOUR SCALE SET> --api-version 2018-06-01 | python -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['identity']['principalId'])")

az role assignment create --assignee $principalid --role 'Contributor' --scope "/subscriptions/<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<YOUR RG>/providers/<PROVIDER NAME>/<RESOURCE TYPE>/<RESOURCE NAME>"
```
-- VMSS MSI enable system assign, link to user assigned docs
-- Code snippet consuming
### Security Policies
-- XML manifest for run as 
### Windows Defender 
"[By default](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/windows-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server-2016), Windows Defender Antimalware is installed and functional on Windows Server 2016. The user interface is installed by default on some SKUs, but is not required." Given the performance impact and resource consumption overhead, if you security policies allow you to exclude processes and paths for open source software, then you will declare the following Virtual Machine Scale Set Extension Resource Manager template properties:

```json
 {
    "name": "[concat('VMIaaSAntimalware','_vmNodeType0Name')]",
    "properties": {
        "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Security",
        "type": "IaaSAntimalware",
        "typeHandlerVersion": "1.5",
        "settings": {
            "AntimalwareEnabled": "true",
            "Exclusions": {
                "Paths": "[concat(parameters('svcFabData'), ';', parameters('svcFabLogs'), ';', parameters('svcFabRuntime'))]",
                "Processes": "Fabric.exe;FabricHost.exe;FabricInstallerService.exe;FabricSetup.exe;FabricDeployer.exe;ImageBuilder.exe;FabricGateway.exe;FabricDCA.exe;FabricFAS.exe;FabricUOS.exe;FabricRM.exe;FileStoreService.exe"
            },
            "RealtimeProtectionEnabled": "true",
            "ScheduledScanSettings": {
                "isEnabled": "true",
                "scanType": "Quick",
                "day": "7",
                "time": "120"
            }
        },
        "protectedSettings": null
    }
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> Please refer to your Antimalware documentation for configuring rules if not using Windows Defender; Windows Defender isn't supported on none windows Operating System distributions.

## Networking

-- ARM template with port rules, link to the portal
### Subnets 
-- Each scale set has its own subnet
-- Show a snippet of a subnet and IP configuration - Network profile of VMSS 
### Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer
-- You should provision a Traffic Manager, to ensure that you have a naming service to any backend
-- 1 TM to Multiple LBs, TM Profile
-- Link to DNS aliasing for TM and for LB
## Capacity Planning and Scaling
-- Link to first doc for Capacity Planning and Scaling. You can also programatically and manually - link to them. 
-- A production scaling operation will take at least 30 min plan accordingly, and can take up to several hours. Tradeoff between performance and safety.
### Vertical 
-- Vertical scaling requires a horizontal scale to the appropriate SKU followed by a migration. Based on placement constraints.
-- NodeTypeRef property shown
-- Vertical scaling doc that talks about it
### Horizontal Scaling 
-- Show the VMSS and SF NodeTypeCount properties
-- capacity VMMS instance count, NodeType instance count
### Durability and Reliability Levels
-- Provide the code snippets of the setting of these levels - VM extension, SF resource
-- You should use Silver of greater for your needs. PrimaryNodeType is stateful, if your services running on other node types are also stateful they should be silver. 
## Infrastructure as Code 
-- Sample repo link and API documentation. Modify these samples for these needs.
-- Portal should not be used to provision a production ready cluster.
-- deployment using AZ CLI and Powershell
-- The create SF powershell cmdlet should only be used for dev test
### Service Fabric ARM Resources 
-- JSON Snippet of the types of SF 
-- Cluster, Application, Application Version, Application Type, Service Version, Service Type
-- Link to packaging, explicity put Zip File create from directory. Need to do this to use this resource type. If you are on Linux use a different ZIP file utility. Put the Python snippet.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics
[Monitoring and diagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-overview) are critical to developing, testing, and deploying workloads in any cloud environment. For example, you can track how your applications are used, the actions taken by the Service Fabric platform, your resource utilization with performance counters, and the overall health of your cluster. You can use this information to diagnose and correct issues, and prevent them from occurring in the future.
### Application Monitoring
Application monitoring tracks how features and components of your application are being used. You want to monitor your applications to make sure issues that impact users are caught. The responsibility of application monitoring is on the users developing an application and its services since it is unique to the business logic of your application. It is recommended that you set up application monitoring with [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-monitoring-aspnet).
### Cluster Monitoring
One of Service Fabric's goals is to keep applications resilient to hardware failures. This goal is achieved through the platform's system services' ability to detect infrastructure issues and rapidly failover workloads to other nodes in the cluster. But in this particular case, what if the system services themselves have issues? Or if in attempting to deploy or move a workload, rules for the placement of services are violated? Service Fabric provides diagnostics for these and more to make sure you are informed about activity taking place in your cluster. It is recommended that you set up cluster monitoring with [Diagnostics Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-aggregation-wad) and [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-setup).
### Infrastructure Monitoring
[Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-agent) is our recommendation to monitor cluster level events.
