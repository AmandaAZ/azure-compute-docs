## Azure Service Fabric Application and Cluster Best Practices
To manage Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters successfully, there are some non-default operations that we highly recommend you preform, to optimize for the reliability of your production environment.  
## Security 
For more information about [Azure Security Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/) please check out [Azure Service Fabric security best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-service-fabric-security-best-practices)
### KeyVault
[Azure KeyVault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) is the recommended secrets management service for Azure Service Fabric applications and clusters.
> [!NOTE]
> Azure KeyVault and compute resources must be co-located in the same region.  
-- Portal Blade Common Name Cert Generation
-- Deploy Certificate URL for VMSS Resource
### CommonName Certificates
-- How to SF extension ACKL 
-- SF Cluster Resource Common Name properties
-- Provide context around bringing your own custom domain
### Encrypting Secret Values 
-- PowerShell way
-- OpenSSL way
### Azure Active Directory (AAD) for client identity
-- ARM properties for enabling AAD
### Compute Managed Service Identity (MSI)
-- VMSS MSI enable system assign, link to user assigned docs
-- Code snippet consuming
### Security Policies
-- XML manifest for run as 
### Windows Defender 
-- Windows defender for VMSS extension, and whitelist properties

## Networking
For more information about networking
### Network Security Group (NSG)
-- ARM template with port rules, link to the portal
### Subnets 
-- Each scale set has its own subnet \
-- Show a snippet of a subnet and IP configuration - Network profile of VMSS 
### Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Load Balancer
-- You should provision a Traffic Manager, to ensure that you have a naming service to any backend
-- 1 TM to Multiple LBs, TM Profile
-- Link to DNS aliasing for TM and for LB

## Capacity Planning and Scaling
Before creating any Azure Service Fabric cluster it is important to [plan for capacity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-capacity) by considering many items during the process.
* The number of node types your cluster needs to start out with
* The properties of each of node type (size, primary, internet facing, number of VMs, etc.)
* The reliability and durability characteristics of the cluster

A production scaling operation can take upwards of 30 mintues and therfore should be planned for accordingly.
> [!NOTE]
> You should  review all Not Allowed upgrade policy values during planning. This is to ensure that you set the values appropriately and to mitigate burning down of your cluster later because of unchangeable system configuration settings.


-- Link to first doc for Capacity Planning and Scaling. You can also programatically and manually - link to them. 
-- A production scaling operation will take at least 30 min plan accordingly, and can take up to several hours. Tradeoff between performance and safety.
### Vertical 
-- Vertical scaling requires a horizontal scale to the appropriate SKU followed by a migration. Based on placement constraints.
-- NodeTypeRef property shown
-- Vertical scaling doc that talks about it
### Horizontal Scaling 
-- Show the VMSS and SF NodeTypeCount properties
-- capacity VMMS instance count, NodeType instance count
### Durability and Reliability Levels
-- Provide the code snippets of the setting of these levels - VM extension, SF resource
-- You should use Silver of greater for your needs. PrimaryNodeType is stateful, if your services running on other node types are also stateful they should be silver. 
## Infrastructure as Code 
-- Sample repo link and API documentation. Modify these samples for these needs.
-- Portal should not be used to provision a production ready cluster.
-- deployment using AZ CLI and Powershell
-- The create SF powershell cmdlet should only be used for dev test
### Service Fabric ARM Resources 
-- JSON Snippet of the types of SF 
-- Cluster, Application, Application Version, Application Type, Service Version, Service Type
-- Link to packaging, explicity put Zip File create from directory. Need to do this to use this resource type. If you are on Linux use a different ZIP file utility. Put the Python snippet.

## Monitoring and Diagnostics
[Monitoring and diagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-overview) are critical to developing, testing, and deploying workloads in any cloud environment. For example, you can track how your applications are used, the actions taken by the Service Fabric platform, your resource utilization with performance counters, and the overall health of your cluster. You can use this information to diagnose and correct issues, and prevent them from occurring in the future.
### Application Monitoring
Application monitoring tracks how features and components of your application are being used. You want to monitor your applications to make sure issues that impact users are caught. The responsibility of application monitoring is on the users developing an application and its services since it is unique to the business logic of your application. It is recommended that you set up application monitoring with [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-monitoring-aspnet).
### Cluster Monitoring
One of Service Fabric's goals is to keep applications resilient to hardware failures. This goal is achieved through the platform's system services' ability to detect infrastructure issues and rapidly failover workloads to other nodes in the cluster. But in this particular case, what if the system services themselves have issues? Or if in attempting to deploy or move a workload, rules for the placement of services are violated? Service Fabric provides diagnostics for these and more to make sure you are informed about activity taking place in your cluster. It is recommended that you set up cluster monitoring with [Diagnostics Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-aggregation-wad) and [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-setup).
### Infrastructure Monitoring
[Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-agent) is our recommendation to monitor cluster level events.
