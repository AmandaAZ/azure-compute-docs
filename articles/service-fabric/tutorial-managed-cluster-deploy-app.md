This part of the series covers how to:

> * Create a new resource group
> * Deploy a Service Fabric managed cluster
> * Deploy an application to a Service Fabric managed cluster

## Prerequisites

* A Service Fabric managed cluster (see [*Deploy a managed cluster*](tutorial-managed-cluster-deploy.md)).

> [!Note]
> In the Service Fabric managed cluster preview you will not be able to publish applications directly from Visual Studio.

## Connect to your cluster

To connect to your cluster you must first take note of the cluster certificate thumbprint. You can find this value in the cluster properties output of your resource deployment or by querying the cluster properties on an existing resource. 

The following command can be used to query your cluster resource for the cluster certificate thumbprint. 
```powershell
$serverThumbprint = (Get-AzResource -ResourceId /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/myCluster).Properties.clusterCertificateThumbprint
``` 

Once you have retrieved the value for the cluster certificate thumbprint you can connect to your cluster. 
```powershell
$connectionEndpoint = "mycluster.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com:19000"
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint $connectionEndpoint -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
      -X509Credential `
      -ServerCertThumbprint $serverThumbprint  `
      -FindType FindByThumbprint `
      -FindValue $clientThumprint `
      -StoreLocation CurrentUser `
      -StoreName My

```

### Upload Application Package 
In this tutorial, we will be using the [Service Fabric Voting Application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-quickstart) sample. For more details on Service Fabric application deployment through PowerShell see [Service Fabric deploy and remove applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-deploy-remove-applications).

```powershell
$path = "C:\Users\<user>\Documents\service-fabric-dotnet-quickstart\Voting\pkg\Debug"
Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage -ApplicationPackagePath $path -ImageStoreConnectionString "fabric:ImageStore"
Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType -ApplicationPathInImageStore Debug
```

### Create an Application
You can instantiate an application from any application type version that has been registered successfully by using the New-ServiceFabricApplication cmdlet. The name of each application must start with the "fabric:" scheme and must be unique for each application instance. Any default services defined in the application manifest of the target application type are also created.

```powershell
New-ServiceFabricApplication fabric:/Voting VotingType 1.0.0
```

Once this operation completes, you can should see your application instances running in the Service Fabric Explorer. 

### Remove an Application
When an application instance is no longer needed, you can permanently remove it by name using the Remove-ServiceFabricApplication cmdlet. Remove-ServiceFabricApplication automatically removes all services that belong to the application as well, permanently removing all service state.

```powershell
Remove-ServiceFabricApplication fabric:/Voting
```

## Next steps

In this step we created and deployed our first Service Fabric managed cluster. To learn more about how to scale a cluster, see:
