# Monitoring and Diagnostics
[Monitoring and diagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-overview) are critical to developing, testing, and deploying workloads in any cloud environment. For example, you can track how your applications are used, the actions taken by the Service Fabric platform, your resource utilization with performance counters, and the overall health of your cluster. You can use this information to diagnose and correct issues, and prevent them from occurring in the future.

## Application Monitoring
Application monitoring tracks how features and components of your application are being used. You want to monitor your applications to make sure issues that impact users are caught. The responsibility of application monitoring is on the users developing an application and its services since it is unique to the business logic of your application. It is recommended that you set up application monitoring with [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-monitoring-aspnet).

## Cluster Monitoring
One of Service Fabric's goals is to keep applications resilient to hardware failures. This goal is achieved through the platform's system services' ability to detect infrastructure issues and rapidly failover workloads to other nodes in the cluster. But in this particular case, what if the system services themselves have issues? Or if in attempting to deploy or move a workload, rules for the placement of services are violated? Service Fabric provides diagnostics for these and more to make sure you are informed about activity taking place in your cluster. It is recommended that you set up cluster monitoring with [Diagnostics Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-event-aggregation-wad) and [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-setup).

## Infrastructure Monitoring
[Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-oms-agent) is our recommendation to monitor cluster level events.
