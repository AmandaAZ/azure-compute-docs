# Quickstart: deploy an Azure Service Fabric Linux container application on Azure
Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform for deploying and managing scalable and reliable microservices and containers. 

This quickstart shows how to deploy Linux containers to a Service Fabric cluster. Once complete, you have a voting application consisting of a Python web front-end and a Redis back-end running in a Service Fabric cluster. 

![quickstartpic][quickstartpic]

In this quickstart you use a Bash instance of Azure Cloud Shell as your Linux environment. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

## Get the application package
To deploy containers to Service Fabric, you need a set of manifest files (the application definition), which describe the individual containers and the application.

In the Cloud Shell, use git to clone a copy of the application definition.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-containers.git

cd service-fabric-containers/Linux/container-tutorial/Voting
```

## Create a Service Fabric cluster
To deploy the application to Azure, you need a Service Fabric cluster to run the application. 

Party clusters offer an easy way to quickly create a Service Fabric cluster. Party clusters are free, limited-time Service Fabric clusters hosted on Azure and run by the Service Fabric team where anyone can deploy applications and learn about the platform. The cluster uses a single self-signed certificate for node-to-node as well as client-to-node security.

Sign in and join a [Linux cluster](http://aka.ms/tryservicefabric). Download the PFX certificate to your computer by clicking the **PFX** link. Click the **ReadMe** link to find the certificate password and instructions about how to configure various environments to use the certificate. Keep both the **Welcome** page and the **ReadMe** page open, you will use some of the instructions in the following steps. 

> [!Note]
> There are a limited number of party clusters available per hour. If you get an error when you try to sign up for a party cluster, you can wait for a period and try again, or you can follow these steps in [Create a Service Fabric cluster on Azure](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-linux-cluster.md) to create a cluster in your subscription. 
> 
>If you do create your own cluster, note that the web front end service is configured to listen on port 80 for incoming traffic. Make sure that port is open in your cluster. (If you are using a party cluster, this port is open.)
>

## Configure certificate
Service Fabric exposes several tools that you can use to perform management operations on a cluster:

- Service Fabric Explorer, a browser-based tool.
- Service Fabric Command Line Interface (CLI), which runs on top of Azure CLI 2.0.
- PowerShell commands. 

In this quickstart you use the CLI (from Cloud Shell) and Service Fabric Explorer. The following sections show you how to install the certificates to connect to your secure cluster with these tools.

### Add certificate for the Service Fabric CLI
To use the CLI you need to upload the certificate PFX file to the cloud drive associated with your Cloud Shell session and convert it to a PEM format.

1. Upload the certificate to your cloud drive.
    1. To determine the Azure File Share that is mounted as your cloud drive, enter the `df` command at the Cloud Shell prompt. In the command output find the file system that is mounted on your cloud drive. Note the name of the Azure storage account and the name of the file share.

        ![df commmand output](./media/service-fabric-quickstart-containers-linux/df-command-output.png) 
       
    1.  From **All resources** in the Azure portal, search for the storage account name, then click the storage account. Under **Services**, click **Files** to open the **File service** view. From the list of file shares, click the share mounted as your cloud drive.
    2.  Click **Upload** and follow the prompts to browse and upload the certificate to your cloud drive.

        ![Upload certificate to cloud drive](./media/service-fabric-quickstart-containers-linux/upload-file.png) 

1. To connect to the service cluster you need to convert the PFX file that you uploaded to a PEM file. The **ReadMe** page contains instructions to convert the PFX file. 
    1. In Cloud Shell, change directories to your cloud drive:

        ```bash
        cd ~/clouddrive
        ``` 

    7. To convert your PFX file to a PEM file use the following command. (For party clusters, you can copy the command specific to your PFX file from the instructions on the **ReadMe** page.)

        ```bash
        openssl pkcs12 -in party-cluster-1486790479-client-cert.pfx -out party-cluster-1486790479-client-cert.pem -nodes -passin pass:1486790479
        ``` 

6. To connect to your secure cluster with the CLI, use the following command. The endpoint is the management endpoint for your cluster. (For party clusters, the endpoint is available on the Welcome page and you can copy a command specific to your PEM file from the instructions on the **ReadMe** page.)

    ```bash
    sfctl cluster select --endpoint https://lnx243cm44yjoi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080 --pem ./party-cluster-1486790479-client-cert.pem --no-verify
    ``` 
 

### Configure Service Fabric Explorer
To use Service Fabric Explorer, you need to import the certificate PFX file you downloaded from the Party Cluster website into your certificate store (Windows or Mac) or into the browser itself (Ubuntu). You need the PFX private key password, which you can get from the **ReadMe** page. For example:

- On Windows: Double-click the PFX file and follow the prompts to install the certificate in your personal store, `Certificates - Current User\Personal\Certificates`. Alternatively, you can use the PowerShell command in the **ReadMe** instructions.
- On Mac: Double-click the PFX file and follow the prompts to install the certificate in your Keychain.
- On Ubuntu: Mozilla Firefox is the default browser in Ubuntu 16.04. To import the certificate into Firefox, click the menu button in the upper right corner of your browser, then click **Options**. On the **Preferences** page, use the search box to search for "certificates". Click **View Certificates**, Select the **Your Certificates** tab, click **Import** and follow the prompts to import the certificate. 


## Install Service Fabric Command Line Interface and Connect to your cluster

Connect to the Service Fabric cluster in Azure using the Azure CLI. The endpoint is the management endpoint of your cluster - for example, `https://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080`.

```bash
sfctl cluster select --endpoint https://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080 --pem party-cluster-1277863181-client-cert.pem --no-verify
```

## Deploy the Service Fabric application 
1. In Cloud Shell, connect to the Service Fabric cluster in Azure using the CLI. The endpoint is the management endpoint for your cluster. (For party clusters, the endpoint is available on the **Welcome** page and you can copy a command specific to your PEM file from the instructions on the **ReadMe** page.)

    ```bash
    sfctl cluster select --endpoint https://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080 --pem party-cluster-1277863181-client-cert.pem --no-verify
    ```

2. Use the install script to copy the Voting application definition to the cluster, register the application type, and create an instance of the application.

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to Service Fabric Explorer at https://\<my-azure-service-fabric-cluster-url>:19080/Explorer; for example, `https://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer`. (For party clusters, you can find the Service Fabric Explorer endpoint for your cluster on the **Welcome** page.) 

3. Expand the Applications node to see that there is now an entry for the Voting application type and the instance you created.

    ![Service Fabric Explorer][sfx]

3.  To connect to the running container, open a web browser and navigate to the URL of your cluster; for example, `http://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:80`. You should see the Voting application in the browser.

    ![quickstartpic][quickstartpic]


> [!NOTE]
> You can also deploy Service Fabric applications with Docker compose. For example, the following command could be used to deploy and install the application on the cluster using Docker Compose.
>  ```bash
> sfctl compose create --deployment-name TestApp --file-path ../docker-compose.yml
> ```

## Fail over a container in a cluster
Service Fabric makes sure your container instances automatically move to other nodes in the cluster should a failure occur. You can also manually drain a node for containers and move then gracefully to other nodes in the cluster. You have multiple ways of scaling your services, in this example, we are using Service Fabric Explorer.

To fail over the front-end container, do the following steps:

1. Open Service Fabric Explorer in your cluster; for example, `https://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer`.
2. Click on the **fabric:/Voting/azurevotefront** node in the tree view and expand the partition node (represented by a GUID). Notice the node name in the treeview, which shows you the nodes that the container is currently running on - for example `_nodetype_4`
3. Expand the **Nodes** node in the tree view. Click on the ellipsis (three dots) next to the node that is running the container.
4. Choose **Restart** to restart that node and confirm the restart action. The restart causes the container to fail over to another node in the cluster.

    ![sfxquickstartshownodetype][sfxquickstartshownodetype]

## Scale applications and services in a cluster
Service Fabric services can easily be scaled across a cluster to accommodate for the load on the services. You scale a service by changing the number of instances running in the cluster.

To scale the web front-end service, do the following steps:

1. Open Service Fabric Explorer in your cluster; for example,`https://linh1x87d1d.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080`.
2. Click on the ellipsis (three dots) next to the **fabric:/Voting/azurevotefront** node in the treeview and choose **Scale Service**.

    ![containersquickstartscale][containersquickstartscale]

  You can now choose to scale the number of instances of the web front-end service.

3. Change the number to **2** and click **Scale Service**.
4. Click on the **fabric:/Voting/azurevotefront** node in the tree-view and expand the partition node (represented by a GUID).

    ![containersquickstartscaledone][containersquickstartscaledone]

    You can now see that the service has two instances. In the tree view, you can see which nodes the instances run on.

By this simple management task, we doubled the resources available for our front-end service to process user load. It's important to understand that you do not need multiple instances of a service to have it run reliably. If a service fails, Service Fabric makes sure a new service instance runs in the cluster.

## Clean up resources
1. Use the uninstall script provided in the template to delete the application instance from the cluster and unregister the application type. This command takes some time to clean up the instance and the 'install'sh' command should not be run immediately after this script. 

    ```bash
    ./uninstall.sh
    ```

2. Remove the certificate from your certificate store. For example:
   - On Windows: Use the [Certificates MMC snap-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-view-certificates-with-the-mmc-snap-in). Be sure to select **My user account** when adding the snap-in. Navigate to `Certificates - Current User\Personal\Certificates` and remove the certificate.
   - On Mac: Use the Keychain app.
   - On Ubuntu: Follow the steps you used to view certificates and remove the certificate.

3. If you don't want to continue to use Cloud Shell, you can delete the storage account associated with it to avoid charges. Close your Cloud Shell session. In Azure portal, click the storage account associated with Cloud Shell, then click **Delete** at the top of the page and respond to the prompts.
