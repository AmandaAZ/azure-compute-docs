# Configure security policies for your application
By using Azure Service Fabric, you can secure applications that are running in the cluster under different user accounts. Service Fabric also helps secure the resources that are used by applications at the time of deployment under the user accounts--for example, files, directories, and certificates. This makes running applications, even in a shared hosted environment, more secure from one another.

By default, Service Fabric applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Service Fabric also provides the capability to run applications under a local user account or local system account, which is specified within the application manifest. Supported local system account types are **LocalUser**, **NetworkService**, **LocalService**, and **LocalSystem**.

 When you're running Service Fabric on Windows Server in your datacenter by using the standalone installer, you can use Active Directory domain accounts, including group managed service accounts.

You can define and create user groups so that one or more users can be added to each group to be managed together. This is useful when there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level.

### Use an Active Directory domain group or user
For an instance of Service Fabric that was installed on Windows Server by using the standalone installer, you can run the service under the credentials for an Active Directory user or group account. This is Active Directory on-premises within your domain and is not with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). By using a domain user or group, you can then access other resources in the domain (for example, file shares) that have been granted permissions.

The following example shows an Active Directory user called *TestUser* with their domain password encrypted by using a certificate called *MyCert*. You can use the `Invoke-ServiceFabricEncryptText` PowerShell command to create the secret cipher text. See [Managing secrets in Service Fabric applications](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md) for details.

You must deploy the private key of the certificate to decrypt the password to the local machine by using an out-of-band method (in Azure, this is via Azure Resource Manager). Then, when Service Fabric deploys the service package to the machine, it is able to decrypt the secret and (along with the user name) authenticate with Active Directory to run under those credentials.

```xml
<Principals>
  <Users>
    <User Name="TestUser" AccountType="DomainUser" AccountName="Domain\User" Password="[Put encrypted password here using MyCert certificate]" PasswordEncrypted="true" />
  </Users>
</Principals>
<Policies>
  <DefaultRunAsPolicy UserRef="TestUser" />
  <SecurityAccessPolicies>
    <SecurityAccessPolicy ResourceRef="MyCert" PrincipalRef="TestUser" GrantRights="Full" ResourceType="Certificate" />
  </SecurityAccessPolicies>
</Policies>
<Certificates>
```
