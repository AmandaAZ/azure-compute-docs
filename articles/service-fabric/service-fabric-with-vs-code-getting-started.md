# Service Fabric for Visual Studio Code

The Service Fabric extension for Visual Studio Code provides the tools necessary to create, build, and debug Service Fabric applications on both Windows, Linux, and macOS Oprating Systems.

This article provides an overview of the requirements and setup of the extension as well as the usage of the various commands that are provided. 

## Dependencies

As VS Code is a lightweight editor, a number of dependencies must be first installed before Service Fabric applications can be created using VS Code.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* Yeoman Generators
```sh
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-azuresfjava
npm install -g generator-azuresfcsharp
```

#### Windows Only

If you are using VS Code on Windows, a bash shell must be installed. Bash on Ubuntu (On Windows) can be installed by following these [instructions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide).

## Setup (Debug)

1. Open a bash shell and navigate to the directory where the extension folder is stored.
2. Run the command **npm install** inside the extension folder.
3. Open the VS Code application.
4. **Windows Only**
Click on File -> Preferences -> Settings in order to open up the settings file. Add "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe" to the settings file in order to enable VS Code to use bash.
5. Click on File -> Open Folder and select the folder of the extension.
6. Press the F5 key to begin debugging the extension, a new VS Code window will open with the title of [Extension Development Host].
7. In the new VS Code window click on File -> Open Folder and select a folder in which you would like to create your Service Fabric Project.

## Setup

1. Open the VS Code application.
2. **Windows Only**
Click on File -> Preferences -> Settings in order to open up the settings file. Add "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe" to the settings file in order to enable VS Code to use bash.
3. Click on the extension icon in the explorer. Search for Service Fabric. Click install for the Service Fabric extension.

## Commands
The Service Fabric extension for VS Code helps developers to create and deploy Service Fabric projects using many commands. Commands can be called pressing (Ctrl + Shift + p), typing the command name into the input bar, and selecting the desired command for the prompt list. 

* Service Fabric: Create Application 
* Service Fabric: Publish Application 
* Service Fabric: Deploy Application 
* Service Fabric: Remove Application  
* Service Fabric: Build Application 
* Service Fabric: Clean Application 

#### Service Fabric: Create Application

The Service Fabric: Create Application command allows you to create a new Service Fabric application in your current workspace. Depending on the yeoman generators that are installed you can create several types of Service Fabric application including Java, C#, Container, and Guest projects. 

1.  Select the command Service Fabric: Add Service 
2.  Select the type of your current Service Fabric application 
3.  Select the type of service that you would like to add to your Service Fabric application 
4.  Follow the prompts for naming the service 
5.  The new Service Fabric application will appear in the workspace
6.  Open the new folder so that this becomes the root folder in the workspace

#### Service Fabric: Add Service
The Service Fabric: Add Service command allows you to create a new service to an existing Service Fabric application. The application that the service will be added to must be the root directory of the workspace. 

1.  Select the command Service Fabric: Add Service 
2.  Select the type of your current Service Fabric application 
3.  Select the type of service that you would like to add to your Service Fabric application 
4.  Follow the prompts for naming the service 
5.  The new service will appear in your project directory 

#### Service Fabric: Publish Application
The Service Fabric: Publish Application command deploys your Service Fabric application on a remote cluster the can be either secure or unsecure.

1.  The first time that the application is built, a Cloud.json file will be generated in the project directory
2.  Input the values for the cluster that you would like to connect in the Cloud.json file  
3.  Select the command Service Fabric: Publish Application  
4.  View the Service Fabric Explorer of the desired cluster to ensure that the application has been installed 

#### Service Fabric: Deploy Application (Localhost)
The Service Fabric: Deploy Application command deploys your Service Fabric application on a one box cluster if you currently have one running. 

1.  Select the command Service Fabric: Deploy Application 
2.  View the Service Fabric Explorer of the local cluster to ensure that the application has been installed

#### Service Fabric: Remove Application
The Service Fabric: Remove Application command removes a Service Fabric application from the cluster that it was deployed to through the VS Code extension. 

1.  Select the command Service Fabric: Remove Application 
2.  View the Service Fabric Explorer to ensure that the application was removed

#### Service Fabric: Build Application
The Service Fabric: Remove Application command can build either Java or C# Service Fabric Application. 

1.  Select the command Service Fabric: Build Application 
2.  Select the application type either Java or C# 
3.  The output of the build process will be output in the integrated terminal

## Debugging

#### Java
[Install Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)

1. Open a Java Service Fabric Project in VS Code
2. Click on the debug icon in the workspace
3. Click on the dropdown and select Add Configuration
4. When prompted to select environment, select Java 

6. Update entryPoint.sh of the service you wish to debug, so that it starts the java process with remote debug parameters. This file can be found at the following location: ApplicationName\ServiceNamePkg\Code\entrypoint.sh. Port 8001 is set for debugging in this example. 

```Java
java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8001,server=y,suspend=y -Djava.library.path=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH -jar myapp.jar 
```

7.  Enter the Service Fabric: Deploy Application command  
8.  Place breakpoints to debug 

#### C# 

[Install C# for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)

When debugging applications in Visual Studio Code, the application must be running on a local cluster. Breakpoints can be added to the code to see what is happening in the code.

To look at what happens in the code, complete the following steps:
1. Set a breakpoint in the code file that you want to debug.
2. Click on the debug icon in the workspace to open the debugging view in Visual Studio Code. Select .NET Core Attach from the configuration menu located next to the run button.
![Debug Icon in Visual Studio Code Workspace][debug-icon]
3. In Visual Studio Code click on the run icon beside the .Net Core Attach debug configuration. In the process selection dialog select the process that corresponds to the service that you would like to debug.
4. The breakpoint in the code file will be hit when that line of code is executed.
5. To continue execution of the program, click on the run icon on the top toolbar of Visual Studio Code.
6. To end the debugging session, click on the plug icon on the top toolbar of Visual Studio Code.
