With SF managed clusters, reduced support cost and better customer satisfaction (and productivity):

	• Simplify cluster deployment and management: deploy and manage single resource, cert mgmt and autorotation, simplified scaling ops
	• Prevent customer errors and enforce best practices: config mismatches w/underlying resources, simplified reliability/durability settings, unsafe operations blocked (eg deleting seed nodes)

There is no additional cost for managed SFRP beyond the cost of underlying resources required for the cluster.
