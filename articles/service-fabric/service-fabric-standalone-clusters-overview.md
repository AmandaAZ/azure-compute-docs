# Overview of Service Fabric Standalone clusters

### Any cloud deployments vs. on-premises deployments
The process for creating a Service Fabric cluster on-premises is similar to the process of creating a cluster on any cloud of your choice with a set of VMs. The initial steps to provision the VMs are governed by the cloud provider or on-premises environment that you are using. Once you have a set of VMs with network connectivity enabled between them, then the steps to set up the Service Fabric package, edit the cluster settings, and run the cluster creation and management scripts are identical. This ensures that your knowledge and experience of operating and managing Service Fabric clusters is transferable when you choose to target new hosting environments.

## Supported operating systems for standalone clusters
You are able to create clusters on VMs or computers running these operating systems (Linux is not yet supported):

* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2016
