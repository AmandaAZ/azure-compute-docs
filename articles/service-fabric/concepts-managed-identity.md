# Managed Identity for Service Fabric Application [ PREVIEW ]

## What is Managed Identity?
A common challenge when building cloud applications is how to manage the credentials in your code for authenticating to cloud services. Keeping the credentials secure is an important task, since they never appear on developer workstations and aren't checked into source control. The managed identities for Azure resources feature in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) solves this problem. The feature provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.

The managed identities for Azure resources feature is free with Azure AD for Azure subscriptions. There's no additional cost.

> [!NOTE]
> Managed identities for Azure resources is the new name for the service formerly known as Managed Service Identity (MSI).

## Terminology
The following terms are used throughout the managed identities for Azure resources documentation set:
- **Client ID** - a unique identifier generated by Azure AD that is tied to an application and service principal during its initial provisioning.
- **Principal ID** - the object ID of the service principal object for your managed identity that is used to grant role-based access to an Azure resource.
- **Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)** - a REST endpoint accessible to all IaaS VMs created via the Azure Resource Manager. The endpoint is available at a well-known non-routable IP address (169.254.169.254) that can be accessed only from within the VM.

- [How does System-Assigned Managed Identity work in Azure ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-a-system-assigned-managed-identity-works-with-an-azure-vm)

- [How does User-Defined Managed Identity(MI) work in Azure ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-works-with-an-azure-vm)


## Supported scenarios for Service Fabric Application 
   For preview release, we ONLY allow these actions to be deployed in Azure Service Fabric Applications for the below supported scenarios:
   - Deploy a new application with one or more services that has Managed Identity enabled.
   - Upgrade an application to use managed identity to access Azure resources 
   - Roll back or disable a managed identity by removing application using Azure Resource Manager. This action will automatically ONLY remove system-assigned managed identities.
>
> [!NOTE]
>
>  It is not recommended to enable this feature in Production clusters. One user-assigned or system-assigned identity can be associated to one or more application.
