# Create Service Fabric container running Apache Tomcat server on Linux
Some text

## Prerequisites
* A development computer running:
  * [Service Fabric SDK and tools](service-fabric-get-started-linux.md).
  * [Docker CE for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#prior-releases). 
  * [Service Fabric CLI](service-fabric-cli.md)

* A registry in Azure Container Registry - Create a container registry [using the Azure portal](../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal.md) or [using the Azure CLI](./service-fabric-tutorial-create-container-images#deploy-azure-container-registry) in your Azure subscription. 

## Steps

1. Clone the Service Fabric Tomcat application on your development computer.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suhuruli/dev_test.git
   cd dev_test
   git checkout TomcatServiceFabric 
   ```
1. Create a Docker file based on the official [Tomcat image](https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat/) located on Docker Hub and the application you cloned in the previous step. In the *dev_test* directory, create a file named *Dockerfile* (with no file extension). Add the following to *Dockerfile* and save your changes:

   ```
   FROM library/tomcat

   EXPOSE 8080

   COPY ./ApacheTomcat /usr/local/tomcat
   ```

   Read the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for more information.


4. Run the `docker build` command to create the image that runs your web application:

   ```bash
   docker build . -t tomcattest
   ```

   This command builds the new image using the instructions in the Dockerfile, naming (-t tagging) the image `tomcattest`. To build a container image, the base image is first downloaded down from Docker Hub and the application is added to it. 

   Once the build command completes, run the `docker images` command to see information on the new image:

   ```bash
   $ docker images
    
   REPOSITORY                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   tomcattest                    latest              86838648aab6        2 minutes ago       194 MB
   ```

5. Verify that your containerized application runs locally before pushing it the container registry:
 
   ```bash
   docker run -itd --name tomcat-site -p 8080:8080 tomcattest.
   ```
   
   * `--name` names the container, so you can refer to it using a friendly name rather than its ID.
   * `-p` specifies the port mapping between the container and the host OS. 

   > [!Note]
   > The port you open with the `-p` parameter should be the port your Tomcat application listens to requests on. In the current example, there is a Connector configured in the *ApacheTomcat/conf/server.xml* file to listen on port 8080 for HTTP requests. This port is mapped to port 8080 on the host. 

   To learn about other parameters, see the [Docker run documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).

1. To test your container, open a browser and enter one of the following URLs. You will see a variant of the "Hello World!" welcome screen for each URL.

   - http://localhost:8080/hello 
   - http://localhost:8080/hello/sayhello 
   - http://localhost:8080/hello/sayhi 


2. Stop the container and delete it from your development computer:

   ```bash
   docker stop tomcat-site
   docker rm tomcat-site
   ```

1. Push the image you created to your container registry.
   1. Run `docker login` to log in to your container registry with your [registry credentials](../container-registry/container-registry-authentication.md).

      The following example passes the ID and password of an Azure Active Directory [service principal](../active-directory/active-directory-application-objects.md). For example, you might have assigned a service principal to your registry for an automation scenario. Or, you could log in using your registry username and password.

      ```bash
      docker login myregistry.azurecr.io -u xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx -p myPassword
      ```

   2. The following command creates a tag, or alias, of the image, with a fully qualified path to your registry. This example places the image in the `samples` namespace to avoid clutter in the root of the registry.

      ```bash
      docker tag tomcattest myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/tomcattest
      ```

   3. Push the image to your container registry:

      ```bash
      docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/tomcattest
      ```
1. Use yeoman to create a scaffold for a container application: 

   ```
   yo azuresfcontainer 
   ```
   Enter the following values when prompted:

   * Name your application: ServiceFabricTomcat
   * Name of the application service: TomcatService
   * Input the Image Name: myregistry.azurecr.io/samples/tomcattest
   * Commands: 
   * Number of instances of guest container application: 1

10. In the service manifest, add the following under the root **ServiceManfest** tag to open the port your application is listening to requests on.

    ```xml
    <Resources>
	  <Endpoints>
	    <!-- This endpoint is used by the communication listener to obtain the port on which to 
	     listen. Please note that if your service is partitioned, this port is shared with 
	     replicas of different partitions that are placed in your code. -->
	    <Endpoint Name="endpointTest" Port="8080" Protocol="tcp"/>
	  </Endpoints>
	</Resources>
    ```

11. In the application manifest, under the **ServiceManifestImport** tag, add the following. Replace the AccountName and Password in the RepositoryCredentials tag with the name of your container registry and the password required to login to it.

    ```xml
    <Policies>
	  <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
	    <PortBinding ContainerPort="8080" EndpointRef="endpointTest"/>
		<RepositoryCredentials AccountName="myregistry" Password="=P==/==/=8=/=+u4lyOB=+=nWzEeRfF=" PasswordEncrypted="false"/>
	  </ContainerHostPolicies>
	</Policies>
    ```
12. In the *ServiceFabricTomcat* folder, connect to your service fabric cluster and run the install.sh script to deploy the application. 

    * To connect to the local Service Fabric cluster, run

       ```bash
       sfctl cluster select --endpoint http://localhost:19080
       ```

    * To connect to an Azure cluster, make sure the client certificate is present as a .pem file in the *ServiceFabricTomcat* folder, and run: 

       ```bash
       sfctl cluster select --endpoint https://PublicIPorFQDN:19080 -pem your-certificate.pem -no-verify
       ```
       In the preceding command, replace `your-certificate.pem` with the name of your client certificate file. In development and test environments, the cluster certificate is often used as the client certificate. If your certificate is not self-signed, omit the `-no-verify` parameter. 
       
       Cluster certificates are typically downloaded locally as .pfx files. If you don't already have your certificate in PEM format, you can run the following command to create a .pem file from a .pfx file:

       ```bash
       openssl pkcs12 -in your-certificate.pfx -out your-certificate.pem -nodes -passin pass:your-pfx-password
       ```

       If your .pfx file is not password protected, use `-passin pass:` for the last parameter.


13. Run the install script provided in the template to deploy the application to your cluster. The script copies the application package to the cluster's image store, registers the application type, and creates an instance of the application.

       ```bash
       ./install.sh
       ```

    After you have run the install script, open a browser and navigate to Service Fabric Explorer:
    
    * On a local cluster, use http://localhost:19080/Explorer (replace *localhost* with the private IP of the VM if using Vagrant on Mac OS X).
    * On an Azure cluster, use https://PublicIPorFQDN:19080/Explorer. 
    
    Expand the **Applications** node and note that there is now an entry for your application type, **ServiceFabricTomcatType**, and another for the first instance of that type. (It may take a few minutes for the application to fully deploy, so be patient.)

1. To access the application on the Tomcat server, open a browser window and enter any of the following URLs. You will see a variant of the "Hello World!" welcome screen for each URL.

   * http://PublicIPorFQDN:8080/hello/hello/sayhi
   * http://PublicIPorFQDN:8080/hello/hello  
   * http://PublicIPorFQDN:8080/hello/hello/sayhello
