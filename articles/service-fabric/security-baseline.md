# Azure security baseline for Service Fabric

This security
baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version
1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview-v1.md) to Service Fabric. The Azure Security Benchmark
provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure
Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Service Fabric. **Controls** not applicable to Service Fabric have been excluded.

 
To see how Service Fabric completely maps to the Azure
Security Benchmark, see the [full Service Fabric security baseline mapping
file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24083).

**Guidance**: Use Security Center and remediate network protection recommendations for the virtual network, subnet, and network security group being used to secure your Azure Service Fabric cluster. Enable network security group flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account to traffic audit. You may also send network security groups flow logs to an Azure Log Analytics Workspace and use Azure Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24084).

**Guidance**: Provide a front-end gateway to provide a single point of ingress for users, devices, or other applications. Azure API Management integrates directly with Service Fabric, allowing you to secure access to back-end services, prevent DOS attacks by using throttling, and verify API keys, JWT tokens, certificates, and other credentials.

Consider deploying Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of critical web applications for additional inspection of incoming traffic. Enable Diagnostic Setting for WAF and ingest logs into a Storage Account, Event Hub, or Log Analytics Workspace.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24089).

**Guidance**: Use Virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups (NSG) that are attached to the subnet your Azure Service Fabric cluster is deployed in. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24090).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources related to your Azure Service Fabric cluster. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ServiceFabric" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Service Fabric cluster.

You may also use Azure Blueprints to simplify large-scale Azure deployments by packaging key environment artifacts, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure RBAC controls, and policies, in a single blueprint definition. Easily apply the blueprint to new subscriptions and environments, and fine-tune control and management through versioning.

### 9.4: Ensure protection of backups and customer-managed keys

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24162).

**Guidance**: Backups from Service Fabric backup restore service use an Azure Storage account in your subscription. Azure Storage encrypts all data in a storage account at rest. By default, data is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys. For additional control over encryption keys, you can supply customer-managed keys for encryption of storage data.

If you are using customer-managed-keys, ensure Soft-Delete in Key Vault is enabled to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.

### 10.1: Create an incident response guide

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24163).

**Guidance**: Develop an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure there are written incident response plans that define all the roles of personnel as well as the phases of incident handling and management from detection to post-incident review. 

- [Guidance on building your own security incident response process](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/01/inside-the-msrc-building-your-own-security-incident-response-process/)

### 10.2: Create an incident scoring and prioritization procedure

>[!TIP]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/24164).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
