# Configure security policies for your application
By using Azure Service Fabric, you can secure applications that are running in the cluster under different user accounts. Service Fabric also helps secure the resources that are used by applications at the time of deployment under the user accounts--for example, files, directories, and certificates. This makes running applications, even in a shared hosted environment, more secure from one another.

By default, Service Fabric applications run under the account that the Fabric.exe process runs under. Service Fabric also provides the capability to run applications under a local user account or local system account, which is specified within the application manifest. Supported local system account types are **LocalUser**, **NetworkService**, **LocalService**, and **LocalSystem**.

 When you're running Service Fabric on Windows Server in your datacenter by using the standalone installer, you can use Active Directory domain accounts, including group managed service accounts.

You can define and create user groups so that one or more users can be added to each group to be managed together. This is useful when there are multiple users for different service entry points and they need to have certain common privileges that are available at the group level.

## Configure the policy for a service setup entry point
As described in [Application and service manifests](service-fabric-application-and-service-manifests.md), the setup entry point, **SetupEntryPoint**, is a privileged entry point that runs with the same credentials as Service Fabric (typically the *NetworkService* account) before any other entry point. The executable that is specified by **EntryPoint** is typically the long-running service host. So having a separate setup entry point avoids having to run the service host executable with high privileges for extended periods of time. The executable that **EntryPoint** specifies is run after **SetupEntryPoint** exits successfully. The resulting process is monitored and restarted, and begins again with **SetupEntryPoint** if it ever terminates or crashes.

The following is a simple service manifest example that shows the SetupEntryPoint and the main EntryPoint for the service.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ServiceManifest Name="MyServiceManifest" Version="SvcManifestVersion1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <Description>An example service manifest</Description>
  <ServiceTypes>
    <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="MyServiceType" />
  </ServiceTypes>
  <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0.0">
    <SetupEntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
        <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
      </ExeHost>
    </SetupEntryPoint>
    <EntryPoint>
      <ExeHost>
        <Program>MyServiceHost.exe</Program>
      </ExeHost>
    </EntryPoint>
  </CodePackage>
  <ConfigPackage Name="Config" Version="1.0.0" />
</ServiceManifest>
```

### Configure the policy by using a local account
After you configure the service to have a setup entry point, you can change the security permissions that it runs under in the application manifest. The following example shows how to configure the service to run under user administrator account privileges.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
   <ServiceManifestImport>
      <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyServiceTypePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
      <ConfigOverrides />
      <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupAdminUser" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
   </ServiceManifestImport>
   <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupAdminUser">
            <MemberOf>
               <SystemGroup Name="Administrators" />
            </MemberOf>
         </User>
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

First, create a **Principals** section with a user name, such as SetupAdminUser. This indicates that the user is a member of the Administrators system group.

Next, under the **ServiceManifestImport** section, configure a policy to apply this principal to **SetupEntryPoint**. This tells Service Fabric that when the **MySetup.bat** file is run, it should be `RunAs` with administrator privileges. Given that you have *not* applied a policy to the main entry point, the code in **MyServiceHost.exe** runs under the system **NetworkService** account. This is the default account that all service entry points are run as.

Let's now add the file MySetup.bat to the Visual Studio project to test the administrator privileges. In Visual Studio, right-click the service project and add a new file called MySetup.bat.

Next, ensure that the MySetup.bat file is included in the service package. By default, it is not. Select the file, right-click to get the context menu, and choose **Properties**. In the Properties dialog box, ensure that **Copy to Output Directory** is set to **Copy if newer**. See the following screenshot.

![Visual Studio CopyToOutput for SetupEntryPoint batch file][image1]

Now open the MySetup.bat file and add the following commands:

```
REM Set a system environment variable. This requires administrator privilege
setx -m TestVariable "MyValue"
echo System TestVariable set to > out.txt
echo %TestVariable% >> out.txt

REM To delete this system variable us
REM REG delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v TestVariable /f
```

Next, build and deploy the solution to a local development cluster. After the service has started, as shown in Service Fabric Explorer, you can see that the MySetup.bat file was successful in a two ways. Open a PowerShell command prompt and type:

```
PS C:\ [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine")
MyValue
```

Then, note the name of the node where the service was deployed and started in Service Fabric Explorer--for example, Node 2. Next, navigate to the application instance work folder to find the out.txt file that shows the value of **TestVariable**. For example, if this service was deployed to Node 2, then you can go to this path for the **MyApplicationType**:

```
C:\SfDevCluster\Data\_App\Node.2\MyApplicationType_App\work\out.txt
```

### Configure the policy by using local system accounts
Often, it's preferable to run the startup script by using a local system account rather than an administrator account. Running the RunAs policy as a member of the Administrators group typically doesnâ€™t work well because machines have User Access Control (UAC) enabled by default. In such cases, **the recommendation is to run the SetupEntryPoint as LocalSystem, instead of as a local user added to Administrators group**. The following example shows setting the SetupEntryPoint to run as LocalSystem:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" ApplicationTypeName="MyApplicationType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">
   <ServiceManifestImport>
      <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="MyServiceTypePkg" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0.0" />
      <ConfigOverrides />
      <Policies>
         <RunAsPolicy CodePackageRef="Code" UserRef="SetupLocalSystem" EntryPointType="Setup" />
      </Policies>
   </ServiceManifestImport>
   <Principals>
      <Users>
         <User Name="SetupLocalSystem" AccountType="LocalSystem" />
      </Users>
   </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

For Linux clusters, to run a service or the setup entry point as **root**, you can specify the  **AccountType** as **LocalSystem**.

## Start PowerShell commands from a setup entry point
To run PowerShell from the **SetupEntryPoint** point, you can run **PowerShell.exe** in a batch file that points to a PowerShell file. First, add a PowerShell file to the service project--for example, **MySetup.ps1**. Remember to set the *Copy if newer* property so that the file is also included in the service package. The following example shows a sample batch file that starts a PowerShell file called MySetup.ps1, which sets a system environment variable called **TestVariable**.

MySetup.bat to start a PowerShell file:

```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ".\MySetup.ps1"
```

In the PowerShell file, add the following to set a system environment variable:

```
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable", "MyValue", "Machine")
[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("TestVariable","Machine") > out.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, when the batch file runs, it looks at the application folder called **work** for files. In this case, when MySetup.bat runs, we want this to find the MySetup.ps1 file in the same folder, which is the application **code package** folder. To change this folder, set the working folder:
> 
> 

```xml
<SetupEntryPoint>
    <ExeHost>
    <Program>MySetup.bat</Program>
    <WorkingFolder>CodePackage</WorkingFolder>
    </ExeHost>
</SetupEntryPoint>
```
