# Create AWS Infrastructure to host a service fabric cluster

This tutorial is part one of a series.  Service Fabric for Windows Server deployment (standalone) offers you the option to choose your own environment and create a cluster as part of our "any OS, any cloud" approach with Service Fabric. This tutorial shows you how to create the AWS infrastructure necessary to host this standalone cluster.

In part one of the series, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a set of EC2 instances
> * VPC?
> * Security Groups?
> * Login to one of the instances

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this tutorial you need an AWS account and method to make an RDP connection.

## Create a VPC

## Create an EC2 instance

Login to the AWS Console
In the search box enter EC2
Click on Launch Instance
Select Windows 2016 Base
Select t2.medium -> Next: Configure Instance Details
Change number of instances to 3 - how does Auto Scaling interact with Sevice Fabric?
Leave the Networking preferences set to the default options.
Expand Advanced details

In order to connect your virtual machines together in service fabric you need the VMs to have the same credentials.  The two most common ways to do this are to join them all to a domain or update the Administrator password on each VM.  For this tutorial we will use a user data script to ensure they all have the same password.  In a production environment you should join them to a domain as storing credentials in the user data field of a VM is not secure.

Enter the following script in the user data field on the console.

```powershell
<powershell>
$user = [adsi]"WinNT://localhost/Administrator,user"
$user.SetPassword("serv1ceF@bricP@ssword")
$user.SetInfo()
</powershell>
```

Click on **Next: Storage**
Click on **Next: Add Tags**
Add a Name tag of Azure Service Fabric Cluster
Click on **Next: Configure Security Group**
Create a new security group
Change the name to service-fabric-cluster
Update the description if you would like
Click on **Review and Launch**
Check to ensure all the settings are as desired.
**Click Launch**
Change the drop down to proceed with out a key pair, in this case we do not need a key to retrieve the password, as we are setting it in the user data script.'

**Click Launch Instances**


## Connect to an instance and validate inter-connectivity
**Click View Instances**

## Next steps

In part one of the series, you learned about uploading large amounts of random data to a storage account in parallel, such as how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Configure the connection string
> * Build the application
> * Run the application
> * Validate the number of connections

Advance to part two of the series to download large amounts of data from a storage account.
