# Azure Service Fabric node types and virtual machine scale sets
Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure compute resource. You can use scale sets to deploy and manage a collection of virtual machines as a set. For each node type that you define in an Azure Service Fabric cluster, set up a separate scale set. You can then independently scale each node type up or down, have different sets of ports open, and have different capacity metrics.

The following figure shows a cluster that has two node types, named FrontEnd and BackEnd. Each node type has five nodes each.

## Map virtual machine scale set instances to nodes
As shown in the preceding figure, the virtual machine scale set instances start at instance 0, and then increase by 1. The numbering is reflected in the node names. For example, BackEnd_0 is instance 0 of the BackEnd virtual machine scale set. This particular virtual machine scale set has five instances, named BackEnd_0, BackEnd_1, BackEnd_2, BackEnd_3 and BackEnd_4.

When you scale up a virtual machine scale set, a new instance is created. The new scale set instance name typically is the scale set name plus the next instance number. In our example, it is BackEnd_5.

## Map scale set load balancers to node types and scale sets
If you deployed your cluster in the Azure portal or used the sample Azure Resource Manager template, all resources under a resource group are listed. You see the load balancers for each scale set or node type.

The name looks similar to this: **LB-&lt;node type name&gt;**. For example, LB-sfcluster4doc-0, as shown in the following figure:

## <a name="remote-connect-to-a-vm-scale-set"></a>Remotely connect to a scale set instance or cluster node
For each node type that you defined in a cluster, set up a separate scale set. You can independently scale the node types up or down. Additionally, you can use different VM SKUs. Unlike single-instance VMs, virtual machine scale set instances don't have their own virtual IP address. This can be challenging when you are looking for an IP address and port that you can use to remotely connect to a specific instance.

To find an IP address and port that you can use to remotely connect to a specific instance:

**Step 1**: Find the virtual IP address for the node type by getting the inbound NAT rules for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

First, get the inbound NAT rules values that were defined as a part of the resource definition for **Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers**.

1. In the portal, go to the load balancer page, and then select **Settings**.

    ![Load balancer][LBBlade]

2. Select **Inbound NAT rules**. This gives you the IP address and port that you can use to remotely connect to the first virtual machine scale set instance. In the following figure, the IP address and port are **104.42.106.156** and **3389**

    ![NAT rules][NATRules]

**Step 2**: Find the port that you can use to remotely connect to the specific scale set instance or node.

Virtual machine scale set instances map to nodes. Use that information to determine the exact port.

Ports are allocated in ascending order that match the virtual machine scale set instance. For the earlier example of the FrontEnd node type, the ports for each of the five instances are listed in the following table. Apply the same mapping for your virtual machine scale set instance.

| **Virtual machine scale set instance** | **Port** |
| --- | --- |
| FrontEnd_0 |3389 |
| FrontEnd_1 |3390 |
| FrontEnd_2 |3391 |
| FrontEnd_3 |3392 |
| FrontEnd_4 |3393 |
| FrontEnd_5 |3394 |

**Step 3**: Remotely connect to the specific virtual machine scale set instance.

The following figure demonstrates using Remote Desktop Connection to connect to the FrontEnd_1 scale set instance:

## Change the RDP port range values

### Before cluster deployment
When you set up the cluster by using a Resource Manager template, specify the range in `inboundNatPools`.

Go to the resource definition for `Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers`. Locate the description for `inboundNatPools`.  Replace the `frontendPortRangeStart` and `frontendPortRangeEnd` values.

![inboundNatPools values][InboundNatPools]

### After cluster deployment
Changing the RDP port range values after the cluster has been deployed is more involved. Ensure that you avoid recycling the VMs. Use Azure PowerShell to set new values. 

Ensure that you have Azure PowerShell 1.0 or a later version installed on your computer. If you don't have Azure Powershell 1.0 or a later version, we recommend that you follow the steps outlined in [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell.](/powershell/azure/overview)

1. Sign in to your Azure account. If this PowerShell command fails for some reason, verify that you installed PowerShell installed correctly.

    ```
    Login-AzureRmAccount
    ```

2. To get details about your load balancer, and to see the values for the description for `inboundNatPools`, run the following code:

    ```
    Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -ResourceType Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers -ResourceName <load balancer name>
    ```

3. Set `frontendPortRangeEnd` and `frontendPortRangeStart` to the values that you want.

    ```
    $PropertiesObject = @{
        #Property = value;
    }
    Set-AzureRmResource -PropertyObject $PropertiesObject -ResourceGroupName <resource group name> -ResourceType Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers -ResourceName <load balancer name> -ApiVersion <use the API version that is returned> -Force
    ```

## Change the RDP user name and password for nodes

The following steps outline how to change the password for all nodes of a given Node Type. These changes will apply to all current and future nodes in the virtual machine scale set.

1. Open PowerShell as an Administrator. 
2. To log in and select your subscription for the session, run the following commands. Change the `SUBSCRIPTIONID` parameter to your subscription ID. 

    ```powershell
    Login-AzureRmAccount
    Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId 'SUBSCRIPTIONID' | Select-AzureRmSubscription
    ```

3. Run the following script. Use the relevant `NODETYPENAME`, `RESOURCEGROUP`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` values. The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` values are the new credentials that you use in future RDP sessions. 

    ```powershell
    $nodeTypeName = 'NODETYPENAME'
    $resourceGroup = 'RESOURCEGROUP'
    $publicConfig = @{'UserName' = 'USERNAME'}
    $privateConfig = @{'Password' = 'PASSWORD'}
    $extName = 'VMAccessAgent'
    $publisher = 'Microsoft.Compute'
    $node = Get-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -VMScaleSetName $nodeTypeName
    $node = Add-AzureRmVmssExtension -VirtualMachineScaleSet $node -Name $extName -Publisher $publisher -Setting $publicConfig -ProtectedSetting $privateConfig -Type $extName -TypeHandlerVersion '2.0' -AutoUpgradeMinorVersion $true

    Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $nodeTypeName -VirtualMachineScaleSet $node
    ```
