# Query EventStore APIs for cluster events

This doc covers how to query the EventStore APIs that are available in Service Fabric version 6.2 and later - if you would like to learn more about the EventStore, please see the [EventStore Overview](service-fabric-diagnostics-eventstore.md).

>[!NOTE]
>As of Service Fabric version 6.2. the EventStore APIs are currently in preview for Windows clusters running on Azure only. We are working on porting this functionality to Linux as well as our Standalone clusters.

The EventStore APIs can be accessed directly via a REST endpoint, or programmatically. Depending on the query, there are several parameters that are required to gather the right data. These typically include:
* `api-version`: the version of the EventStore APIs you are using
* `StartTimeUtc`: defines the start of the period you are interesting in looking at
* `EndTimeUtc`: end of the time period

In addition to these, there are optional parameters available as well, such as:
* `timeout`: override the default 60 seconds timeout for performing the request operation
* `ExcludeAnalysisEvents`: do not return 'Analysis' events - these are "intelligent" operational channel events with additional context or info beyond a regular cluster event 
* `SkipCorrelationLookup`: do not look for potential correlated events in the cluster

## Query the EventStore via REST API endpoints

You can query the EventStore directly via an REST endpoint, by making `GET` requests to:
`<your cluster address>/EventsStore/<entity>/Events/`.

For example, in order to query for all Cluster events between `2018-04-03T18:00:00Z` and `2018-04-04T18:00:00Z`, your request would look like:

```
Method: GET 
URL: http://localhost:19080/EventsStore/Cluster/Events?api-version=6.2-preview&StartTimeUtc=2018-04-03T18:00:00Z&EndTimeUtc=2018-04-04T18:00:00Z
```

This could either return an error if no events are available, or if the query was successful:

```json
Response: 200
Body:
[
  {
    "Kind": "ClusterUpgradeStart",
    "CurrentClusterVersion": "0.0.0.0:",
    "TargetClusterVersion": "6.2:1.0",
    "UpgradeType": "Rolling",
    "RollingUpgradeMode": "UnmonitoredAuto",
    "FailureAction": "Manual",
    "EventInstanceId": "090add3c-8f56-4d35-8d57-a855745b6064",
    "TimeStamp": "2018-04-03T20:18:59.4313064Z",
    "HasCorrelatedEvents": false
  },
  {
    "Kind": "ClusterUpgradeDomainComplete",
    "TargetClusterVersion": "6.2:1.0",
    "UpgradeState": "RollingForward",
    "UpgradeDomains": "(0 1 2)",
    "UpgradeDomainElapsedTimeInMs": "78.5288",
    "EventInstanceId": "090add3c-8f56-4d35-8d57-a855745b6064",
    "TimeStamp": "2018-04-03T20:19:59.5729953Z",
    "HasCorrelatedEvents": false
  },
  {
    "Kind": "ClusterUpgradeDomainComplete",
    "TargetClusterVersion": "6.2:1.0",
    "UpgradeState": "RollingForward",
    "UpgradeDomains": "(3 4)",
    "UpgradeDomainElapsedTimeInMs": "0",
    "EventInstanceId": "090add3c-8f56-4d35-8d57-a855745b6064",
    "TimeStamp": "2018-04-03T20:20:59.6271949Z",
    "HasCorrelatedEvents": false
  },
  {
    "Kind": "ClusterUpgradeComplete",
    "TargetClusterVersion": "6.2:1.0",
    "OverallUpgradeElapsedTimeInMs": "120196.5212",
    "EventInstanceId": "090add3c-8f56-4d35-8d57-a855745b6064",
    "TimeStamp": "2018-04-03T20:20:59.8134457Z",
    "HasCorrelatedEvents": false
  }
]
```

Here we can see that between `2018-04-03T18:00:00Z` and `2018-04-04T18:00:00Z`, this cluster successfully completed its first upgrade when it was first stood up, from `"CurrentClusterVersion": "0.0.0.0:"` to `"TargetClusterVersion": "6.2:1.0"`, in `"OverallUpgradeElapsedTimeInMs": "120196.5212"`.

## Query the EventStore programmatically

You can also query the EventStore programmatically, via the [Service Fabric client library](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/service-fabric?view=azure-dotnet#client-library).

Once you have your Service Fabric Client set up, you can query for events by accessing the EventStore like this:
` sfhttpClient.EventStore.<request>`

Here is an example request for all cluster events between `2018-04-03T18:00:00Z` and `2018-04-04T18:00:00Z`, via the `GetClusterEventListAsync` function.

```csharp
var sfhttpClient = ServiceFabricClientFactory.Create(clusterUrl, settings);

var clstrEvents = sfhttpClient.EventsStore.GetClusterEventListAsync(
    "2018-04-03T18:00:00Z",
    "2018-04-04T18:00:00Z")
    .GetAwaiter()
    .GetResult()
    .ToList();
```

## Sample scenarios and queries

Here are few examples on how you can call the Event Store REST APIs to help identify and diagnose issues in your cluster.

1. Failure to update your cluster's Service Fabric version
If you are you unable to update your cluster's version, you should start by looking at whether or not the upgrade was iniated correctly and where it failed. Use this query to see all “cluster” level events: `https://vipinrtobit.cloudapp.net:19080/EventsStore/Cluster/Events?api-version=6.2-preview&starttimeutc=2017-03-24T17:01:51Z&endtimeutc=2019-03-29T17:02:51Z`. You'll see various events, including the successful initiation of the upgrade, and the UDs for which the upgrade rolled through succesfully. You will also see events for the point at which the rollback started and corresponding health events.
