# Deploy a container to Service Fabric

This article walks you through the process of building containerized services for Windows and Linux.

Service Fabric has several capabilities that help you with building applications that are composed of microservices running inside containers. 

The capabilities include:

* Container image deployment and activation
* Resource governance
* Repository authentication
* Container port-to-host port mapping
* Container-to-container discovery and communication
* Ability to configure and set environment variables

Let's look at how each of capabilities works when you're packaging a containerized service to be included in your application.

## Package a Windows container
When you package a container, you can choose to use either a Visual Studio project template or [create the application package manually](#manually).  When you use Visual Studio, the application package structure and manifest files are created by the New Project template for you.

> [!TIP]
> The easiest way to package an existing container image into a service is to use Visual Studio.

### Use Visual Studio to package an existing container image
Visual Studio provides a Service Fabric service template to help you deploy a container to a Service Fabric cluster.

1. Choose **File** > **New Project**, and create a Service Fabric application.
2. Choose **Guest Container** as the service template.
3. Choose **Image Name** and provide the path to the image in your container repository. For example, `myrepo/myimage:v1` in https://hub.docker.com
4. Give your service a name, and click **OK**.
5. If your containerized service needs an endpoint for communication, you can now add the protocol, port, and type to the ServiceManifest.xml file. For example: 
     
    `<Endpoint Name="MyContainerServiceEndpoint" Protocol="http" Port="80" UriScheme="http" PathSuffix="myapp/" Type="Input" />`
    
    By providing the `UriScheme`, Service Fabric automatically registers the container endpoint with the Naming service for discoverability. The port can either be fixed (as shown in the preceding example) or dynamically allocated. If you don't specify a port, it is dynamically allocated from the application port range (as would happen with any service).
    You also need to configure the container to host port mapping by specifying a `PortBinding` policy in the application manifest. For more information, see [Configure container to host port mapping](#Portsection).
6. If your container needs resource governance then add a `ResourceGovernancePolicy`.
8. If your container needs to authenticate with a private repository, then add `RepositoryCredentials`.
7. If you are running on a Windows Server 2016 machine with container support enabled, you can use the package and publish action to deploy to your local cluster. 
8. When ready, you can publish the application to a remote cluster or check in the solution to source control. 

For an example, checkout the [Service Fabric container code samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-containers)

### Creating a Windows Server 2016 cluster
To deploy your containerized application, you need to create a cluster running Windows Server 2016 with container support enabled. 
Your cluster may be running locally, or deployed via Azure Resource Manager in Azure. 

To deploy a cluster using Azure Resource Manager, choose the **Windows Server 2016 with Containers** image option in Azure. 
See the article [Create a Service Fabric cluster by using Azure Resource Manager](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm.md). Ensure that you use the following Azure Resource Manager settings:

```xml
"vmImageOffer": { "type": "string","defaultValue": "WindowsServer"     },
"vmImageSku": { "defaultValue": "2016-Datacenter-with-Containers","type": "string"     },
"vmImageVersion": { "defaultValue": "latest","type": "string"     },  
```
You can also use the [Five Node Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/service-fabric-secure-cluster-5-node-1-nodetype)
to create a cluster. Alternatively read a community [blog post](https://loekd.blogspot.com/2017/01/running-windows-containers-on-azure.html) on using Service Fabric and Windows containers.

## Packaging a Linux Docker container with yeoman
When packaging a container on Linux, you can choose either to use a yeoman template or [create the application package manually](#manually).

A Service Fabric application can contain one or more containers, each with a specific role in delivering the application's functionality. The Service Fabric SDK for Linux includes a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator that makes it easy to create your application and add a container image. Let's use Yeoman to create an application with a single Docker container called *SimpleContainerApp*. You can add more services later by editing the generated manifest files.

### Install Docker on your development box

Run the following commands to install docker on your Linux development box (if you are using the vagrant image on OSX, docker is already installed):

```bash
    sudo apt-get install wget
    wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/ | sh
```

### Create the application
1. In a terminal, type `yo azuresfcontainer`.
2. Name your application - for example, mycontainerap
3. Provide the URL for the container image from a DockerHub repo. The image parameter takes the form [repo]/[image name]
4. If the image does not have a workload entry-point defined, then you need to explicitly specify input commands with a comma-delimited set of commands to run inside the container, which will keep the container running after startup.

![Service Fabric Yeoman generator for containers][sf-yeoman]

### Deploy the application the Xplat CLI

Once the application is built, you can deploy it to the local cluster using the Azure CLI.

1. Connect to the local Service Fabric cluster.

    ```bash
    azure servicefabric cluster connect
    ```

2. Use the install script provided in the template to copy the application package to the cluster's image store, register the application type, and create an instance of the application.

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

3. Open a browser and navigate to Service Fabric Explorer at http://localhost:19080/Explorer (replace localhost with the private IP of the VM if using Vagrant on Mac OS X).
4. Expand the Applications node and note that there is now an entry for your application type and another for the first instance of that type.
5. Use the uninstall script provided in the template to delete the application instance and unregister the application type.

    ```bash
    ./uninstall.sh
    ```

### Deploy the application Azure CLI 2.0

See the reference doc on managing an [application life cycle using the Azure CLI 2.0](service-fabric-application-lifecycle-azure-cli-2-0.md).

For an example application, [checkout the Service Fabric container code samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-containers)

### Adding more services to an existing application

To add another container service to an application already created using `yo`, perform the following steps:

1. Change directory to the root of the existing application.  For example, `cd ~/YeomanSamples/MyApplication`, if `MyApplication` is the application created by Yeoman.
2. Run `yo azuresfcontainer:AddService`

<a id="manually"></a>

## Manually package and deploy a container image
The process of manually packaging a containerized service is based on the following steps:

1. Publish the containers to your repository.
2. Create the package directory structure.
3. Edit the service manifest file.
4. Edit the application manifest file.

## Deploy and activate a container image
In the Service Fabric [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md), a container represents an application host in which multiple service replicas are placed. To deploy and activate a container, put the name of the container image into a `ContainerHost` element in the service manifest.

In the service manifest, add a `ContainerHost` for the entry point. Then set the `ImageName` to be the name of the container repository and image. The following partial manifest shows an example of how to deploy the container called `myimage:v1` from a repository called `myrepo`:

```xml
    <CodePackage Name="Code" Version="1.0">
        <EntryPoint>
          <ContainerHost>
            <ImageName>myrepo/myimage:v1</ImageName>
            <Commands></Commands>
          </ContainerHost>
        </EntryPoint>
    </CodePackage>
```

You can specify optional commands to run upon starting the container under the `Commands` element. For multiple commands, comma-delimit them. 

## Understand resource governance
Resource governance is a capability of the container that restricts the resources that the container can use on the host. The `ResourceGovernancePolicy`, which is specified in the application manifest is used to declare resource limits for a service code package. Resource limits can be set for the following resources:

* Memory
* MemorySwap
* CpuShares (CPU relative weight)
* MemoryReservationInMB  
* BlkioWeight (BlockIO relative weight).

> [!NOTE]
> Support for specifying specific block IO limits such as IOPs, read/write BPS, and others are planned for a future release.
> 
> 

```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ResourceGovernancePolicy CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code" CpuShares="500"
            MemoryInMB="1024" MemorySwapInMB="4084" MemoryReservationInMB="1024" />
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
```

## Authenticate a repository
To download a container, you might have to provide sign-in credentials to the container repository. The sign-in credentials, specified in the application manifest, are used to specify the sign-in information, or SSH key, for downloading the container image from the image repository. The following example shows an account called *TestUser* along with the password in clear text (*not* recommended):

```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="TestUser" Password="12345" PasswordEncrypted="false"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
```

We recommend that you encrypt the password by using a certificate that's deployed to the machine.

The following example shows an account called *TestUser*, where the password was encrypted by using a certificate called *MyCert*. You can use the `Invoke-ServiceFabricEncryptText` PowerShell command to create the secret cipher text for the password. For more information, see the article [Managing secrets in Service Fabric applications](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md).

The private key of the certificate that's used to decrypt the password must be deployed to the local machine in an out-of-band method. (In Azure, this method is Azure Resource Manager.) Then, when Service Fabric deploys the service package to the machine, it can decrypt the secret. By using the secret along with the account name, it can then authenticate with the container repository.

```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="TestUser" Password="[Put encrypted password here using MyCert certificate ]" PasswordEncrypted="true"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
```

## <a name ="Portsection"></a> Configure container to host port mapping
You can configure a host port used to communicate with the container by specifying a `PortBinding` in the application manifest. The port binding maps the port to which the service is listening inside the container to a port on the host.

```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <PortBinding ContainerPort="8905"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
```

## Configure container-to-container discovery and communication
You can use the `PortBinding` element to map a container port to an endpoint in the service manifest. In the following example, the endpoint `Endpoint1` specifies a fixed port, 8905. It can also specify no port at all, in which case a random port from the cluster's application port range is chosen for you.


```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <Policies>
            <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <PortBinding ContainerPort="8905" EndpointRef="Endpoint1"/>
            </ContainerHostPolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
```
If you specify an endpoint, using the `Endpoint` tag in the service manifest of a guest container, Service Fabric can automatically publish this endpoint to the Naming service. Other services that are running in the cluster can thus discover this container using the REST queries for resolving.

By registering with the Naming service, you can perform container-to-container communication within your container by using the [reverse proxy](service-fabric-reverseproxy.md). Communication is performed by providing the reverse proxy http listening port and the name of the services that you want to communicate with as environment variables. For more information, see the next section. 

## Configure and set environment variables
Environment variables can be specified for each code package in the service manifest. This feature is available for all services irrespective of whether they are deployed as containers or processes or guest executables. You can override environment variable values in the application manifest or specify them during deployment as application parameters.

The following service manifest XML snippet shows an example of how to specify environment variables for a code package:

```xml
    <ServiceManifest Name="FrontendServicePackage" Version="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Description>a guest executable service in a container</Description>
        <ServiceTypes>
            <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="StatelessFrontendService"  UseImplicitHost="true"/>
        </ServiceTypes>
        <CodePackage Name="FrontendService.Code" Version="1.0">
            <EntryPoint>
            <ContainerHost>
                <ImageName>myrepo/myimage:v1</ImageName>
                <Commands></Commands>
            </ContainerHost>
            </EntryPoint>
            <EnvironmentVariables>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value=""/>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value=""/>
            </EnvironmentVariables>
        </CodePackage>
    </ServiceManifest>
```

These environment variables can be overridden at the application manifest level:

```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
        <EnvironmentOverrides CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
            <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value="[BackendSvc]"/>
            <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value="19080"/>
        </EnvironmentOverrides>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
```

In the previous example, we specified an explicit value for the `HttpGateway` environment variable (19000), while we set the value for `BackendServiceName` parameter via the `[BackendSvc]` application parameter. These settings enable you to specify the value for `BackendServiceName`value when you deploy the application and not have a fixed value in the manifest.

## Configure isolation mode

Windows supports two isolation modes for containers - process and Hyper-V.  With the process isolation mode, all the containers running on the same host machine share the kernel with the host. With the Hyper-V isolation mode, the kernels are isolated between each Hyper-V container and the container host. The isolation mode is specified in the `ContainerHostPolicies` tag in the application manifest file.  The isolation modes that can be specified are `process`, `hyperv`, and `default`. The `default` isolation mode defaults to `process` on Windows Server hosts, and defaults to `hyperv` on Windows 10 hosts.  The following snippet shows how the isolation mode is specified in the application manifest file.

```xml
   <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="NodeService.Code" Isolation="hyperv">
```

## Complete examples for application and service manifest

An example application manifest follows:

```xml
    <ApplicationManifest ApplicationTypeName="SimpleContainerApp" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Description>A simple service container application</Description>
        <Parameters>
            <Parameter Name="ServiceInstanceCount" DefaultValue="3"></Parameter>
            <Parameter Name="BackEndSvcName" DefaultValue="bkend"></Parameter>
        </Parameters>
        <ServiceManifestImport>
            <ServiceManifestRef ServiceManifestName="FrontendServicePackage" ServiceManifestVersion="1.0"/>
            <EnvironmentOverrides CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value="[BackendSvcName]"/>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value="19080"/>
            </EnvironmentOverrides>
            <Policies>
                <ResourceGovernancePolicy CodePackageRef="Code" CpuShares="500" MemoryInMB="1024" MemorySwapInMB="4084" MemoryReservationInMB="1024" />
                <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="FrontendService.Code">
                    <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="username" Password="****" PasswordEncrypted="true"/>
                    <PortBinding ContainerPort="8905" EndpointRef="Endpoint1"/>
                </ContainerHostPolicies>
            </Policies>
        </ServiceManifestImport>
    </ApplicationManifest>
```

An example service manifest (specified in the preceding application manifest) follows:

```xml
    <ServiceManifest Name="FrontendServicePackage" Version="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <Description> A service that implements a stateless front end in a container</Description>
        <ServiceTypes>
            <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="StatelessFrontendService"  UseImplicitHost="true"/>
        </ServiceTypes>
        <CodePackage Name="FrontendService.Code" Version="1.0">
            <EntryPoint>
            <ContainerHost>
                <ImageName>myrepo/myimage:v1</ImageName>
                <Commands></Commands>
            </ContainerHost>
            </EntryPoint>
            <EnvironmentVariables>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="HttpGatewayPort" Value=""/>
                <EnvironmentVariable Name="BackendServiceName" Value=""/>
            </EnvironmentVariables>
        </CodePackage>
        <ConfigPackage Name="FrontendService.Config" Version="1.0" />
        <DataPackage Name="FrontendService.Data" Version="1.0" />
        <Resources>
            <Endpoints>
                <Endpoint Name="Endpoint1" UriScheme="http" Port="80" Protocol="http"/>
            </Endpoints>
        </Resources>
    </ServiceManifest>
```

## Start docker daemon on cluster with customer parameters 

Custom parameters can be specified when the Service Fabric runtime launches the docker daemon on the cluster nodes. The parameters are specified in the cluster manifest under the hosting section as shown in the following snippet:

```xml
{
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "DockerParams": "-H fd:// -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock",
	      ...
          }
        ]
}
```

## Configure time interval before container is force terminated

Instead of removing a container service immediately when the service is removed, you can configure a time interval for the runtime to wait before the container is removed. Configuring the time interval sends the `docker stop <time in seconds>` command to the container.   For more detail, see [docker stop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/). The time interval to wait is specified in the cluster manifest under the **Hosting** section as shown in the following snippet (the time interval is set to 10 seconds by default): 

```xml
{
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "ContainerDeactivationTimeout": "10",
	      ...
          }
        ]
}
```
Since this is a dynamic configuration, a config only upgrade on the cluster updates the timeout. 


## Configure the runtime to remove unused container images

You can configure the Service Fabric cluster to remove unused container images from the node if no services are using that image on the node. This allows disk space to be recaptured if too many container images are present on the node.  To enable this feature, update the **Hosting** section in the cluster manifest as shown in the following snippet: 

```xml
{
        "name": "Hosting",
        "parameters": [
          {
	      “PruneCustomerImages”: “True”,
            "DNDImages": "…”,
	      ...
          }
        ]
} 
```

For images that shouldn’t ever be deleted, specify them as do not delete, but adding them under the “DNDImages” parameter as shown above.
