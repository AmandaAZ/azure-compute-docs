## Prerequisites

* A Service Fabric managed cluster (see [*Deploy a managed cluster*](tutorial-managed-cluster-deploy.md)).
* [Azure PowerShell 4.7.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/release-notes-azureps?view=azps-4.7.0#azservicefabric) or later (see [*Install Azure PowerShell*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-4.7.0&preserve-view=true)).

## Add a node type to a Service Fabric managed cluster

You can add a node type to a Service Fabric managed cluster through an Azure Resource Manager template, PowerShell, or CLI. In this tutorial we will be adding a node type using the Azure PowerShell.

To create a new node type, we will need to define three properties:

* **Node Type Name**: This should be a unique name from any other node types that already exist in the cluster.
* **Instance Count**: This will be the initial number of nodes in the new node type.
* **VM Size**: This will be the VM SKU which the nodes are running on. If this property is not specified the default value with be a Standard_D2.

> [!NOTE]
> If the node type being added is the first or only node type in the cluster, the Primary property must be used.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "myCluster"
$nodeTypeName = "nt2"
$vmSize = "Standard_D2_v2"

New-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName -Name $nodeTypeName -InstanceCount 3 -vmSize $vmSize
```

## Remove a node type from a Service Fabric managed cluster

To remove a node type from a Service Fabric managed cluster, you must use PowerShell or CLI. In this tutorial we will be remove a node type using the Azure PowerShell. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to remove a primary node type if it is the only primary node type in the cluster.  

To remove a node type:

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "myCluster"
$nodeTypeName = "nt2"

Remove-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName  -Name $nodeTypeName
```

## Next steps

 In this step we added and deleted node types. To learn more about upgrading, see:
