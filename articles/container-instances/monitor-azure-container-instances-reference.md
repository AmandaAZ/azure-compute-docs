<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Container Instances with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace container-instances with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor Container Instances"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-azure-container-instances.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "Container Instances monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-azure-container-instances-reference.md".

# Container Instances monitoring data reference

<!-- Intro. Required. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-intro.md)]

See [Monitor Container Instances](monitor-azure-container-instances.md) for details on the data you can collect for Container Instances and how to use it.

<!-- ## Metrics. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-ref-metrics-intro.md)]

<!-- Repeat the following section for each resource type/namespace in your service. -->
### Supported metrics for Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
The following table lists the metrics available for the Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups resource type.
<!-- For each ### section:
1. Replace the <ResourceType/namespace> placeholder in the heading and introductory sentence. Example: ### Supported metrics for Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices
2. Find the metrics for the resource type at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/metrics-index#supported-metrics-per-resource-type, which is autogenerated from underlying systems. Either link to the listed metrics page(s), OR #include the metrics table(s).
3. Add any further information after each metric #include or link. -->

<!-- Use either the LINK or INCLUDE option and remove the other option.
- LINK to metrics page. Example: - [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)

## Azure Monitor diagnostic settings

Diagnostic settings is in public preview through a feature flag. The table names appear without *_CL*. Some columns are different, because this is a new flow. For more information, see [Use diagnostic settings](container-instances-log-analytics.md#using-diagnostic-settings).

#### Container Instances
Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
- [ContainerInstanceLog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/containerinstancelog)
- [ContainerEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/containerevent)

<!-- Find the table(s) for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API.
NOTE: Also refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics#azure-diagnostics-mode to see whether your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics. 
Link to the service-specific tables. If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table, list the fields you use and what they're for. If your service uses both tables, list both types of information. Add any further information after each table link, such as descriptions and usage, or information not found in the tables. Example:
### Storage Accounts
Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
- [StorageBlobLogs](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/storagebloblogs) -->
