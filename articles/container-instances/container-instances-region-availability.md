# Region availability for Azure Container Instances

The following sections detail the availability of Azure Container Instances features and resources in Azure regions. For information about service quotas, see [Quotas and limits for Azure Container Instances](container-instances-quotas.md).

## Feature availability

Azure Container Instances can schedule both Windows and Linux containers with the same API. However, the following features are currently available only in Linux container groups. Windows support is planned.

* Multiple containers per container group
* Volume mounting (Azure Files, emptyDir, GitRepo, secret)
* Virtual network (preview)
* GPU resources (preview)

## Region availability

Azure Container Instances is available in the following regions with the specified CPU and memory limits for each container group. Values are current at time of publication. For up-to-date information, use the [List Capabilities](/rest/api/container-instances/listcapabilities/listcapabilities) API. 

Availability and resource limits may differ when using Azure Container Instances with a [virtual network](container-instances-vnet.md) (preview) or with [GPU resources](container-instances-gpu.md) (preview).

| Location | OS | CPU | Memory (GB) |
| -------- | -- | :---: | :-----------: |
| Canada Central, Central US, East US 2, South Central US | Linux | 4 | 16 |
| East US, North Europe, West Europe, West US, West US 2 | Linux | 4 | 14 |
| Japan East | Linux | 2 | 8 |
| Australia East, Southeast Asia | Linux | 2 | 7 |
| Central India, East Asia, North Central US, South India | Linux | 2 | 3.5 |
| East US, West Europe, West US | Windows | 4 | 14 |
| Australia East, Canada Central, Central India, Central US, East Asia, East US 2, Japan East, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, South India, Southeast Asia, West US 2 | Windows | 2 | 3.5 |

Container instances created within these resource limits are subject to availability within the deployment region. When a region is under heavy load, you may experience a failure when deploying instances. To mitigate such a deployment failure, try deploying instances with lower CPU and memory settings, or try your deployment at a later time.

Let the team know of additional regions required or increased CPU/Memory limits at [aka.ms/aci/feedback](https://aka.ms/aci/feedback).
