# Azure Security Baseline for Virtual Machine Scale Sets

The Azure Security Baseline for Virtual Machine Scale Sets contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2086).

**Guidance**: When you create an Azure virtual machine (VM), you must create a virtual network (VNet) or use an existing VNet and configure VM with a subnet.   Ensure that all deployed subnets have a Network Security Group applied with network access controls specific to your applications trusted ports and sources. Use Azure Services with Private Link enabled, deploy the service inside your VNet or connect privately using Private Endpoints. For service specific requirements, please refer to the security recommendation for that specific service.  Alternatively, if customer has a specific use case, Azure Firewall may also be used to meet certain requirements.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Network Security group to configure which network traffic and ports are able to connect to the resources on the Virtual Network.  NSGs contain two sets of rules: inbound and outbound. The priority for a rule must be unique within each set. Each rule has properties of protocol, source and destination port ranges, address prefixes, direction of traffic, priority, and access type.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2089).

**Guidance**: Enable Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Standard protection on the Virtual Networks to guard against DDoS attacks. Using Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence, you can deny communications with known malicious IP addresses.  Configure appropriately Azure Firewall on each of the Virtual Network segments, with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.
You can use Azure Security Center's Just In Time Network access to limit exposure of Windows Virtual Machines to the approved IP addresses for a limited period.  Also, use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG configurations that limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

### 3.1: Maintain Inventory of Administrative Accounts

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2107).

**Guidance**: While Azure Active Directory is the recommended method to administrate user access, Azure Virtual Machines may have local accounts. Both local and domain accounts should be reviewed and managed, normally with a minimum footprint. In addition, we would advise that the Privileged Identity Manager is reviewed for the Just In Time feature to reduce the availability of administrative permissions.

**Guidance**: Utilizes Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the central authentication and authorization system. Azure AD protects data by using strong encryption for data at rest and in transit. Azure AD also salts, hashes, and securely stores user credentials.  You can use managed identities to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code. Your code that's running on a virtual machine, can use managed identity to request access tokens for services that support Azure AD authentication.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/2170).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
