The Upgrade Policy for a Virtual Machine Scale Set can be changed at any point in time. Depending on your scenario, you may want to use a particular Upgrade Policy, like Manual or Automatic, when setting up and developing your workload. Once you are ready to move to Production, you then might want to change it to Rolling. 

### [Portal](#tab/portal2)

Select the Virtual Machine Scale Set you want to change the Upgrade Policy for. In the menu under **Settings**, select **Upgrade Policy** and from the drop-down menu, select the Upgrade Policy you want to enable. 

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for additional configuration options and suggestions.

### [CLI](#tab/cli2)
Update an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set using [az vmss update](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-update).

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for additional configuration options and suggestions.

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --set upgradePolicy.automatic
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell2)
Update an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set using [Update-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvmss). 

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for additional configuration options and suggestions.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet"

Update-Azvmss -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myScaleSet" -UpgradePolicyMode "Manual" -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss
```

### [ARM Template](#tab/template2)

Update the properties section of your ARM template with the Upgrade Policy you wish to use. 

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for additional configuration options and suggestions.


```ARM
"properties": {
        "upgradePolicy": {
            "mode": "Automatic",
        }
    }
```
