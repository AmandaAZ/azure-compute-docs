The Upgrade Policy for a Virtual Machine Scale Set can be changed at any point in time. Depending on your scenario, you may want to use a particular Upgrade Policy when setting up and developing your workload and once you're ready to move to production, change it to another Upgrade Policy mode. 

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Select the Virtual Machine Scale Set you want to change the Upgrade Policy for. In the menu under **Settings**, select **Upgrade Policy** and from the drop-down menu, select the Upgrade Policy you want to enable. 

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for more configuration options and suggestions.

### [CLI](#tab/cli)
Update an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set using [az vmss update](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-update) and the `--set upgradePolicy` parameter.

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for more configuration options and suggestions.

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --set upgradePolicy.automatic
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
Update an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set using [Update-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvmss) and the `-UpgradePolicyMode` parameter.

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for more configuration options and suggestions.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$vmss = Get-AzVmss -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet"

Update-Azvmss -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myScaleSet" -UpgradePolicyMode "Manual" -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss
```

### [ARM Template](#tab/template)

Update the properties section of your ARM template with the Upgrade Policy you wish to use. 

If using a Rolling Upgrade Policy, see [Configure Rolling Upgrade Policy](virtual-machine-scale-sets-configure-rolling-upgrades.md) for more configuration options and suggestions.


```ARM
"properties": {
        "upgradePolicy": {
            "mode": "Automatic",
        }
    }
```
