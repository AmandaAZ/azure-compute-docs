# Upgrade Policy for Virtual Machine Scale Sets

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrade Policy currently only applies to Uniform Orchestration mode. We recommend using Flexible Orchestration for new workloads. For more information, see [Orchesration modes for Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Azure](virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes.md).

Scale sets have an Upgrade Policy that determines how VMs are brought up-to-date with the latest scale set model. This includes updates such as changes in the OS version, adding or removing data disks, NIC updates, or other updates that apply to the scale set instances as a whole. The three modes for the upgrade policy are **Automatic**, **Rolling** and **Manual**. 

### Automatic 
In this mode, the scale set makes no guarantees about the order of VMs being brought down. The scale set may take down all VMs at the same time when performing the upgrade. 

>[!NOTE]
> Service Fabric clusters can only use *Automatic* mode, but the update is handled differently. For more information, see [Service Fabric application upgrades](../service-fabric/service-fabric-application-upgrade.md).

### Rolling

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rolling Upgrades with MaxSurge is currently in preview. Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA). 
>
> To enable this feature for your subscription, run `Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName MaxSurgeRollingUpgrade -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Compute` in CloudShell or search for "MaxSurgeRollingUpgrade" in the list of preview features available in the Azure Portal.

In this mode, the scale set rolls out the update in batches with an optional pause time in between. Additionally, when selecting a **Rolling**, users can select to enable **MaxSurge**. When MaxSurge is enabled, new instances are created and brought up-to-date to the latest scale model in batches. Once complete, the new instances are added to the scale set and the old model instances are removed. This occurs in multiple batches (batch size determined by customer) until all instances are brought up to date. 

With MaxSurge disabled, the existing instances in a scale set are brought down in batches to be upgraded rather than new ones being created. Once the upgrade is complete, the instances will begin taking traffic again. Rolling upgrades with MaxSurge enabled allows the scale set instances to continue to take traffic while upgrades are being done. 

### Manual
In this mode, you choose when to initiate an update to the scale set instances. Nothing happens automatically to the existing VMs when changes occur to the scale model. If no upgrade policy is set during VM creation, the default value is manual. 

## Setting the Upgrade Policy

The Upgrade Policy can be set during scale set creation. Include the Upgrade Policy flag and set it to either Automatic, Rolling or Manual. If using Rolling, include the MaxSurge flag and set it to either true or false. 

### CLI
Create a new Virtual Machine Scale Set using [az vmss create](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-create). 

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

#Create a load balancer
az network lb create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyLoadBalancer --sku Standard

# Create a health probe
az network lb probe create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --lb-name MyLoadBalancer --name MyProbe --protocol tcp --port 80

# Create a load balancing rule and assign the health probe
az network lb rule create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --lb-name myLoadBalancer --name MyLbRule --protocol Tcp --frontend-ip-name LoadBalancerFrontEnd --frontend-port 80 --backend-pool-name MyLoadBalancerbepool --backend-port 80 --probe myProbe

# Create the scale set
az vmss create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --image UbuntuLTS \
    --lb myLoadBalancer \
    --health-probe myProbe \
    --upgrade-policy-mode Rolling \
    --max-surge true \
    --instance-count 2 \
    --disable-overprovision \
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --generate-ssh-keys

```


### PowerShell
Create a new Virtual Machine Scale Set using [New-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmss).

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVmss `
    -ResourceGroup "myResourceGroup" `
    -Name "myScaleSet" ` 
    -UpgradePolicyMode "Rolling" `
    -MaxSurge "True" `
    -Location "East US" `
    -InstanceCount "2" `
    -ImageName "Win2019Datacenter"

```

### Template
When using an ARM template, add the upgradePolicy to the properties section: 

```ARM
"properties": {
    "singlePlacementGroup": false,
        "upgradePolicy": {
            "mode": "Rolling",
            "rollingUpgradePolicy": {
            "maxBatchInstancePercent": 20,
            "maxUnhealthyInstancePercent": 20,
            "maxUnhealthyUpgradedInstancePercent": 20,
            "pauseTimeBetweenBatches": "PT2S",
	        "MaxSurge": "true"
```


## Changing the Upgrade Policy

The Upgrade Policy for a Virtual Machine Scale Set can be changed at any point in time. 

### CLI
Update an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set using [az vmss update](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-update).

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet \
    --upgrade-policy-mode Rolling \
    --max-unhealthy-instance-percent 40 \
    --max-unhealthy-upgraded-instance-percent 30 \
    --pause-time-between-batches PT30S \
    --max-surge true
```

### PowerShell]
Update an existing Virtual Machine Scale Set using [Set-AzVmssRollingUpgradePolicy](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmssrollingupgradepolicy) and [Update-AzVmss](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvmss).

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzVmssRollingUpgradePolicy `
    -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss `
    -MaxBatchInstancePercent 40 `
    -MaxUnhealthyInstancePercent 35 `
    -MaxUnhealthyUpgradedInstancePercent 30 `
    -PauseTimeBetweenBatches "PT30S" `
    -MaxSurge "True"

Update-AzVMSS -VMScaleSetName $vmss
```

### Template

Add the following to your ARM template: 

```ARM
"properties": {
    "singlePlacementGroup": false,
        "upgradePolicy": {
            "mode": "Rolling",
            "rollingUpgradePolicy": {
            "maxBatchInstancePercent": 20,
            "maxUnhealthyInstancePercent": 20,
            "maxUnhealthyUpgradedInstancePercent": 20,
            "pauseTimeBetweenBatches": "PT2S",
	        "MaxSurge": "true"
```

## Performing Manual Upgrades
 
If you have the Upgrade Policy set to manual, you need to trigger manual upgrades of each existing VM to apply changes to the instances based on the updated scale set model. 

> [!NOTE]
> While upgrading, the instances may be restarted.

### CLI
Update Virtual Machine Scale Set instances using [az vmss update-instances](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-update-instances).

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss update-instances --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myScaleSet --instance-ids {instanceIds}
```
### PowerShell
Update Virtual Machine Scale Set instances using [Update-AzVmssInstance](/powershell/module/az.compute/update-azvmssinstance).
    
```azurepowershell-interactive
Update-AzVmssInstance -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet" -InstanceId instanceId
```

### REST API
Update Virtual Machine Scale Set instances using [update instances](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/updateinstances).

```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/myScaleSet/manualupgrade?api-version={apiVersion}
```

## Exceptions to Upgrade Policy

There's' one type of modification to global scale set properties that doesn't follow the upgrade policy. Changes to the scale set OS and Data disk Profile (such as admin username and password) can only be changed in API version *2017-12-01* or later. These changes only apply to VMs created after the change in the scale set model. To bring existing VMs up-to-date, you must do a "reimage" of each existing VM. You can do this reimage using:

> [!NOTE]
> The Reimage flag will reimage the selected instance, restoring it to the initial state. The instance may be restarted, and any local data will be lost.


### CLI
Reimage a Virtual Machine Scale Set instance using [az vmss reimage](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-reimage).

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss reimage --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myScaleSet --instance-id instanceId
```

### PowerShell
Reimage a Virtual Machine Scale Set instance using [Set-AzVmssVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmssvm).

```azurepowershell-interactive
Set-AzVmssVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -VMScaleSetName "myScaleSet" -InstanceId instanceId -Reimage
```

### REST API
Reimage a Virtual Machine Scale Set instance using [reimage](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/reimage).

```rest
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/myScaleSet/reimage?api-version={apiVersion}
```


## Next steps
You can also perform common management tasks on scale sets with the [Azure CLI](virtual-machine-scale-sets-manage-cli.md) or [Azure PowerShell](virtual-machine-scale-sets-manage-powershell.md).
