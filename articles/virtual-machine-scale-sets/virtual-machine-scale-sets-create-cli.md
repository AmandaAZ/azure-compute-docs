# Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set with the Azure CLI 2.0
A virtual machine scale set allows you to deploy and manage a set of identical, auto-scaling virtual machines. You can scale the number of VMs in the scale set manually, or define rules to autoscale based on resource usage such as CPU, memory demand, or network traffic. In this getting started article, you create a virtual machine scale set with the Azure CLI 2.0. You can also create a scale set with [Azure PowerShell](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create-powershell.md) or the [Azure portal](virtual-machine-scale-sets-portal-create.md).

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.20 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 


## Create a scale set
Before you can create a scale set, create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location:

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Now create a virtual machine scale set with [az vmss create](/cli/azure/vmss#create). The following example creates a scale set named *myScaleSet*, and generates SSH keys if they do not exist:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vmss create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --upgrade-policy-mode automatic \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```

It takes a few minutes to create and configure all the scale set resources and VMs.


## Get connection info
To obtain connection information about the VMs in your scale sets, use [az vmss list-instance-connection-info](/cli/azure/vmss#list-instance-connection-info). This command outputs the public IP address and port for each VM that allows you to connect with SSH:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vmss list-instance-connection-info \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSet
```

Load balancer network address translation (NAT) rules were created that allow you to connect to each VM instance in the scale set. Each VM instance has a high-range network port mapped to the local connection port on the VM. These ports start at 50001 and increment for each VM instance. The output is similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "instance 1": "13.82.234.238:50001",
  "instance 2": "13.82.234.238:50002"
}
```

To connect to a VM instance, SSH to the public IP address and specify the individual port. The following example connects to *instance 1* with the public IP address of *13.82.234.238* on port *50001*:

```bash
ssh azureuser@13.82.234.238 -p 50001
```


## Install NGINX web server
To see the scale set in action, install a basic web server. From the SSH connection to your VM, install NGINX with `apt-get` as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Once the NGINX install is complete, disconnect from the session as follows:

```bash
exit
```


## Allow web traffic
To allow traffic to reach the web server, create a load balancer rule with [az network lb rule create](/cli/azure/network/lb/rule#create). The following example creates a rule named *myLoadBalancerRuleWeb*:

```azurecli-interactive 
az network lb rule create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myLoadBalancerRuleWeb \
  --lb-name myScaleSetLB \
  --backend-pool-name myScaleSetLBBEPool \
  --backend-port 80 \
  --frontend-ip-name loadBalancerFrontEnd \
  --frontend-port 80 \
  --protocol tcp
```


## Test your web server
To see your web server in action, obtain the public IP address of your load balancer with [az network public-ip show](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#show). The following example obtains the IP address for *myScaleSetLBPublicIP* created as part of the scale set:

```azurecli-interactive 
az network public-ip show \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myScaleSetLBPublicIP \
    --query [ipAddress] \
    --output tsv
```

Enter the public IP address in to a web browser. The default NGINX web page on your first VM instance is displayed, as shown in the following example:

![Default web page in NGINX](media/virtual-machine-scale-sets-create-cli/default-nginx.png)



## Clean up resources
When no longer needed, you can use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) to remove the resource group, scale set, and all related resources as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```


## Next steps
In this getting started article, you created a basic scale set and manually installed a web server on one of the VM instances. For greater scalability and automation, expand your scale set with the following how-to articles:

- Automatically scale with the [Azure CLI](virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-cli.md), [Azure PowerShell](virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-powershell.md), or the [Azure portal](virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-portal.md)
