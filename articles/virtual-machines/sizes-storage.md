# Storage optimized virtual machine sizes

Storage optimized VM sizes offer high disk throughput and IO, and are ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases.  Examples include Cassandra, MongoDB, Cloudera, and Redis. This article provides information about the number of vCPUs, data disks, and NICs as well as local storage throughput and network bandwidth for each optimized size.
