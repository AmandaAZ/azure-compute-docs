# Monitoring AKS data reference

See [Monitoring AKS](monitor-aks.md) for details on collecting and analyzing monitoring data for AKS.

## Metrics

This section lists all the automatically collected platform metrics collected for AKS.  

|Metric Type | Resource Provider / Type Namespace<br/> and link to individual metrics |
|-------|-----|
| Managed Clusters | [Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftcontainerservicemanagedclusters)
| Connected Clusters | [microsoft.kubernetes/connectedClusters](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftkubernetesconnectedclusters)
| Virtual Machines| [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftcomputevirtualmachines) |
| Virtual Machine ScaleSets | [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftcomputevirtualmachinescalesets)|
| Virtual Machine ScaleSets Virtual Machines | [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftcomputevirtualmachinescalesetsvirtualmachines)|

For more information, see a list of [all platform metrics supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-supported).

## Metric Dimensions

For more information on what metric dimensions are, see [Multi-dimensional metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-metrics#multi-dimensional-metrics).

<!-- listed here /azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftcontainerservicemanagedclusters-->

AKS has the following dimensions associated with its metrics.

| Dimension Name | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| requestKind | Used by metrics such as *Inflight Requests* to split by type of request. |
| condition | Used by metrics such as *Statuses for various node conditions*, *Number of pods in Ready state* to split by condition type. |
| status | Used by metrics such as *Statuses for various node conditions* to split by status of the condition. |
| status2 | Used by metrics such as *Statuses for various node conditions* to split by status of the condition.  |
| node | Used by metrics such as *CPU Usage Millicores* to split by the name of the node. |
| phase | Used by metrics such as *Number of pods by phase* to split by the phase of the pod. |
| namespace | Used by metrics such as *Number of pods by phase* to split by the namespace of the pod. |
| pod | Used by metrics such as *Number of pods by phase* to split by the name of the pod. |
| nodepool | Used by metrics such as *Disk Used Bytes* to split by the name of the nodepool. |
| device | Used by metrics such as *Disk Used Bytes* to split by the name of the device. |

## Resource logs

This section lists the types of resource logs you can collect for AKS.

For reference, see a list of [all resource logs category types supported in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/resource-logs-schema).

This section lists all the resource log category types collected for AKS.  

|Resource Log Type | Resource Provider / Type Namespace<br/> and link to individual metrics |
|-------|-----|
| Managed Clusters | [Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-categories#microsoftcontainerservicemanagedclusters) |

## Azure Monitor Logs tables

This section refers to all of the Azure Monitor Logs Kusto tables relevant to AKS and available for query by Log Analytics. 

|Resource Type | Notes |
