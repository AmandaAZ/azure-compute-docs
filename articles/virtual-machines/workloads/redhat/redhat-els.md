# Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Extended Life Phase

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 life cycle
Starting on 30th November 2020, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will reach end of maintenance phase. The maintenance phase is followed by the Extended Life Phase. As Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 transitions out of the Full/Maintenance Phases, it is strongly recommend to upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or 8. If customers must stay on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, it is recommended to add the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Extended Life Cycle Support (ELS) Add-On to your current Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription.
