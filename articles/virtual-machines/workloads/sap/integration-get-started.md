# Get started with SAP and Azure integration scenarios

[According to SAP over 87% of total global commerce is generated by SAP customers](https://www.sap.com/documents/2017/04/4666ecdd-b67c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) and more SAP systems are running in the cloud each year. The SAP platform provides a foundation for innovation for many companies and can handle various workloads natively. Explore our integration section further to learn how you can combine the Microsoft Azure ecosystem with your SAP workload to accelerate your business outcomes. Among the scenarios are extensions with Power Platform ("keep the ABAP core clean"), secured APIs with Azure API Management, automated business processes with Logic Apps, enriched experiences with SAP Business Technology Platform, uniform data blending dashboards with the Azure Data Platform and more.
