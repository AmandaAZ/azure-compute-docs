#SAP workload on Azure planning and deployment checklist 

This checklist is designed for customers moving their to SAP NetWeaver, S/4HANA and Hybris applications to Azure Infrastructure as a Service.  This checklist should be reviewed together with a customer and SAP partner during the duration of of the project. it is important that a lot of the checks are conducted at the beginning of the project and in the planning phase. Once the deployment is done, elementary changes on deployed Azure infrastructure or SAP software releases can become complex. Review this checklist at key waypoints throughout a project.  Small problems can be detected before they become large problems and sufficient time is exists to re-engineer and test any necessary changes. The checklist in no ways claims to be complete. Dependent on your individual situation, there might be many more checks that need to be conducted. 

The checklist assembled does not include tasks that are independent of Azure.  Example: SAP application Interfaces change during a move to Azure Public Cloud or to a hosting provider.  Nothing specific to Azure will normally change and the SAP partner should normally handle validation of tasks that not Azure specific.  

This checklist can also be used for deployed customers. New features such as Write Accelerator, Availability Zones and new VM types may have been added since a customer deployed.  It is therefore useful to review the checklist periodically with large customers to ensure they are aware of new features in the platform. 

##Project preparation and planning phase
In this phase a migration of workload to Azure is planned. The minimum set of entities and items discussed and defined list like:

1. High Level Design Document – this document should contain: should contain:
	1. The current inventory of SAP components and applications and target application inventory on Azure
	2. A high level solution architecture
	3. Decision on Azure regions to deploy into. For a list of Azure regions, check the [Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/). For services available in each of the Azure regions  check the article [products available per region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
	4. Networking architecture to connect from on-premise into Azure. As a start make yourself familiar with the [Virtual Datacenter blueprint for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/vdc/)
	5. Security principles for running high business impact data in Azure. For reading material start with [Azure Security Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/)
2.	Technical Design Document – that contains:
	1.	A solution block diagram 
	2.	Sizing of compute, storage and networking components in Azure. For SAP sizing of Azure VMs consult SAP support note [#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533) 
	3.	Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery architecture
	4.	Detailed OS, DB, Kernel and SAP support pack versions. it is not a given that any OS release that is supported by SAP NetWeaver or  S/4HANA is supported on Azure VMs. Same is true for DBMS releases. It is mandatory that the following sources get checked in order to align and if necessary upgrade SAP releases, DBMS releases or OS releases in order to be in a SAP and Azure supported window. It is mandatory that you are within SAP and Azure supported release combinations to get full support by SAP and Microsoft. If necessary you need to plan for upgrading some of the software components. More details on supported SAP, OS and DBMS software is documented in these locations:
		1.	SAP support note [#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533). This note defines the minimum OS releases supported on Azure VMs. It also defines minimum database releases required for most non-HANA database. The note also presents the SAP sizing of the different SAP supported Azure VMs.
		2.	SAP support note [#2039619](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2039619). The note defines the Oracle support matrix on Azure. Realize that Oracle does support Windows and Oracle Linux as guest OS in Azure only. This applies for the SAP application layer running SAP instances as well. However, Oracle does not support high availability for SAP Central services. As a result you might need a different OS just for SAP Central services which are not connecting to the Oracle DBMS
		3.	SAP support note [#2235581](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2235581) to get the support matrix for SAP HANA on the different OS releases
		4.	SAP HANA supported Azure VMs and [HANA Large Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture) are listed [here](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html#categories=Microsoft%20Azure)
		5.	[SAP Product Availability Matrix](https://support.sap.com/en/)
		6.	Other SAP notes for other SAP specific products	 
	5.	We recommend strict 3-Tier designs for SAP production systems. Combining ASCS + APP servers on the same VM is generally not recommended.  Servers hosting /sapmnt resources not to be used as File Servers for Interfaces or other purposes.    
3.	Customer/Partner should create an inventory of all SAP interfaces (SAP and non-SAP). 
4.	Design of Foundation Services Design - these would include items like
	1.	Active Directory and DSN design
	2.	Network topology within Azure and assignment of different SAP systems
	3.	[Role based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) structure for different teams in Azure
	3.	Resource Group topology 
	4.	Tagging strategy
	5.	Naming Convention for VMs and other infrastructure components and/or logical names
5.	Microsoft Premier Support Contract – identify MS Technical Account Manager (TAM). for support requirements by SAP read SAP support note [#2015553](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2015553) 
6.	Define number of Azure subscriptions and core quota for the different subscriptions. [Open support requests to increase quotas of Azure subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/resource-manager-core-quotas-request) as necessary 
7.	Data Reduction and data migration plan for migrating SAP data into Azure. For SAP NetWeaver systems, SAP has guidelines on how to keep the volume of a large number of data limited. SAP published [this profound guide](https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/2eb2fba8f8b1421c9a37a8d7233da545/7.0/en-US/Data_Management_Guide_Version_70E.PDF)
8.	Define and decide automated deployment approach. Goal of automation behind infrastructure deployments on Azure is to deploy in a deterministic manner and get deterministic results. A lot of customers use Power Shell or CLI based scripts. But there are various open source technologies that can be used to deploy Azure infrastructure for SAP and even install SAP software. Examples can be found in github:
	1.	[Automated SAP Deployments in Azure Cloud](https://github.com/Azure/sap-hana)
	2.	[SAP HANA ARM Installation](https://github.com/AzureCAT-GSI/SAP-HANA-ARM)
9.	Define a regular design and deployment review cadence between you as customer, system integrator, Microsoft and other involved parties 
 
##Pilot Phase (Optional) 
The pilot can run before or in parallel to project planning and preparation. The phase can also be used to test approaches and design made in the planning and preparation phase. The pilot phase can be stretched to a real proof of concepts. It is recommended to setup and validate a full HA/DR solution as well as security design during a pilot deployment. In some customer cases, scalability tests also can be conducted in this phase. Other customers use deployment of SAP sandbox systems as pilot phase. So we assume you identified a system that you want to migrate into Azure

1.	Optimize data transfer into Azure. Highly dependent on customer cases transfer through [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/) from on-premise was fastest if the Express Circuit had enough bandwidth. With other customers, going through internet figured out to be faster
2.	Test and define whether you want to create own OS images for your VMs in Azure or whether you want to use an image out of the Azure Image gallery. If you are using an image out of the Azure gallery make sure that you take the correct image that reflect the support contract with your OS vendor. For some OS vendors Azure galleries offer bring your own license images. for others OS support is includes in the price
	1.	You can build a generalized image of a Windows VM deployed in Azure based on [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource)
	2.	You can build a generalized image of a Linux VM deployed in Azure based on [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/capture-image)
3.	In case of a SAP heterogeneous platform migration that involves an export and import of the database data test and optimize export and import phases. For large migrations involving SQL Server as the destination platform recommendations can be found [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/saponsqlserver/2017/05/08/sap-osdb-migration-to-sql-server-faq-v6-2-april-2017/). You can take the approach of Migration Monitor in case you don't need a combined release upgrade or SAP DMO process when you combine the migration with a SAP release upgrade
	1.  Export Export, Export file upload to Azure and Import performance.  Maximize overlap between export and import
	2.  Evaluate volume of database between target and destination platform in order to reflect in the infrastructure sizing	
	3.  Validate and optimize timing 
4.	Technical Validation 
	1.	VM Types
		1.	Validate the resources on SAP support notes, SAP HANA hardware directory and SAP PAM again to make sure that there were no changes in supported VMs for Azure, supported OS releases in those VMs and supported SAP and DBMS releases
		2.	Validate again the sizing of your application and the infrastructure you deploy on Azure. In case of moving existing applications you often can derive the necessary SAPS from the infrastructure you use and the [SAP benchmark webpage](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2018-benchmark-directory/#/sd) and compare it to the SAPS numbers listed in SAP support note [#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533). Also keep [this article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/saponsqlserver/2018/11/04/saps-ratings-on-azure-vms-where-to-look-and-where-you-can-get-confused/) in mind
		3.	Evaluate and test the sizing of your Azure VMs in regards to maximum storage throughput and network throughput of the different VM types you chose in the planning phase. The data can be found in:
			1.	[Sizes for Windows virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). It is important to consider the **max uncached disk throughput** for sizing
			2.	[Sizes for Linux virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) It is important to consider the **max uncached disk throughput** for sizing
	2.	Storage
		1.	Use Azure Premium Storage for Database VMs
		2.	Use [Azure managed disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/managed-disks/)
		3.	Use Azure Write Accelerator for DBMS log drives with M-Series. Be aware of Write accelerator limits and usage as documented in [Write Accelerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/how-to-enable-write-accelerator)
		4.	For the different DBMS types check the [generic SAP releated DBMS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/dbms_guide_general) and the DBMS specific documentations the generic document points you to
		5.	For SAP HANA more details are documented in [SAP HANA infrastructure configurations and operations on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations)
	3.	Networking
		1.	Test and evaluate your VNet infrastructure and the distribution of your SAP applications across or within the different VNets
			1.	Evaluate the approach of hub and spoke virtual network architecture or microsegmentation within a single Azure virtual network based on
				1.	Costs due to data exchange between [peered Azure VNets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview). For costs check [Virtual Network Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network/)
				2.	Advantage of fast disconnect of the peering between Vnets in comparision to change NSG to isolate a subnet within a virtual network for cases where applications or VMs hosted in a subnet of the virtual network became a security risk
				3.	Central logging and auditing of network traffic between on-premise, outside world and the virtual datacenter you built up in Azure
			2.	Evaluate and test data path between SAP application layer and SAP DBMS layer. 
				1.	Any placement of [Azure Network Virtual Appliances](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/network-appliances/) in the communication path between the SAP application and the DBMS layer of a SAP NetWeaver, Hybris or S/4HANA based SAP systems is not supported at all
				2.	Placing SAP application layer and SAP DBMS in different Azure virtual networks that are not peered are not supported
				3.	[Azure ASG and NSG rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) are supported to be used to define routes between the SAP application layer and SAP DBMS layer
			3.	Make sure that [Azure Accelerated Networking](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/maximize-your-vm-s-performance-with-accelerated-networking-now-generally-available-for-both-windows-and-linux/) is enabled on the VMs used on the SAP application layer and the SAP DBMS layer. Keep in mind that different OS levels are needed to support Accelerated Networking in Azure:
				1.	Windows Server 2012 R2 or newer releases
				2.	SUSE Linux 12 SP3 or newer releases
				3.	RHEL 7.4 or newer releases
				4.	Oracle Linux 7.5. Using the RHCKL kernel, the release needs to be 3.10.0-862.13.1.el7. Using the Oracle UEK kernel release 5 is required
			4.	 Test and evaluate the network latency between SAP aplication layer VM and DBMS VM according to SAP support note [#500235](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/500235) and SAP support note [#1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926/E). Evaluate the results against network latency guidance of SAP support note [#1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926/E). The network latency should be in the moderate and good range. Exceptions apply to traffic between VMs and HANA Large Instance units as documented [here](#1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926/E)
			5.	 Make sure that ILB deployments are set up to use Direct Server Return. This will reduce latency in cases where Azure ILBs are used for high availability configurations on the DBMS layer
	6.	 Timeout settings
		1.	 Check SAP NetWeaver developer traces of the different SAP instances and make sure that no connection breaks between enqueue server and the SAP work processes are noted. These connection braks can be avoided by setting these two registry parameters:
			1.	 HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveTime = 120000 - see also [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc957549(v=technet.10))
			2.	 HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveInterval = 120000 - see also [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc957548(v=technet.10)) 
		2.	 In order to avoid GUI time outs between one-premise deployed SAP GUI interfaces and SAP application layers deployed in Azure, check whether the following parameters are set in the default.pfl or the instance profile:
			1.	 rdisp/keepalive_timeout = 3600
			2.	 rdisp/keepalive = 20
		3.	 If you use a Windows Failover Cluster configuration, make sure that the time to react on non-responsive nodes is set correctly for Azure. The Microsoft article [Tuning Failover Cluster Network Thresholds](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/clustering/2012/11/21/tuning-failover-cluster-network-thresholds/) lists parameters and how those impact failover senitivity. Of the parameters listed these two should be set with the value:
			1.	 SameSubNetDelay = 2
			2.	 SameSubNetThreshold = 15
5.	 Test your high availability and disaster recovery procedures
	1.	 Simulate failover situations by shutting down VMs or putting operating systems in panic mode in order to figure out whether your failover configurations work as designed. 
	2.	 Measure your times it takes to failover. If the times take too long, consider:
		1.	 For SUSE Linux use SBD devices instead of the Azure Fencing Agent to speed up failover
		2.	 For SAP HANA, if the reload of data takes too long consider to provision more storage bandwidth
	3.	 Test backup and restore sequence and tune if necessary
	4.	 Test across region DR functionality and architecture
6.	Security checks
	1.	Test the validity of the Azure Role based Access architecture you implemented. Goal is to separate and limit access and permissions of different teams. As an example, SAP Basis team members should be able to deploy VMs and assign disks from Azure storage into a given Azure virtual network. However the SAP Basis team should not be able to create own virtual networks or change the settings of existing virtual networks. On the other hand members of the network team should not be able to deploy VMs into virtual networks where SAP application and DBMS VMs are running. Nor should members of the network team be able to change attributes of VMs or even delete those.  
	2.	Verify [NSG and ASC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview) rules are working as expected and shield the protected resources
	3.	Make sure that all resources that need to be encrypted are encrypted. Define and execute processes to backup certificates, store and access those certificates and restore the encrypted entities. 
	4.	Use [Azure Disk Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption-faq) and/or for OS disks where possible from an OS support point of view
	5.	Check that not too many layers of encryption have been used. It does make limited sense to use Azure Disk encryption and then on top one of the DBMS Transparent Database Encryption methods
7.	Performance Testing
	1.	In SAP based on SAP tracing and measurements, compare top 10 online reports to current implementation where applicable 
	2.	In SAP based on SAP tracing and measurements, compare top 10 batch jobs to current implementation where applicable 
	3.	In SAP based on SAP tracing and measurements, compare data transfers through interfaces into the SAP system. Focus on interfaces where you know that the transfer is now going between different locations, like going from on-premise to Azure 
 
## Non-Production Phase 
In this phase, we assume that after a successful pilot or PoC, you are starting to deploy non-production SAP systems into Azure. All the learnings and experiences out of the proof of concepts should be adapted to such a deployment. All the criteria and steps listed in the PoC do apply in this type of deployments as well. 
In this steps you usually deploy development systems, unit tests systems and business regression tests systems into Azure. It is recommended that at least one non-production system in one SAP application line have the full high availability configuration as the future production system is going to have. Additional steps you need to consider during that phase are:  

1.	Before moving systems from the old platform into Azure collect resource consumption data, like CPU usage, storage throughput and IOPS data. Especially from the DBMS layer units, but also from the application layer units. Also measure network and storage latency.
2.	Record the availability usage time patterns of the systems. Goal is to figure out whehter non-production systems need to be 7x24 available or whether there are non-production systems that can be shut down during certain phases of a week or month
3.	Steadily check Azure documentation of Microsoft presentations on channels like [Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) for new functionality that might apply to your deployments
4.	Check SAP notes related to Azure, like support note [#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533) for new VMs ore newly supported OS and DBMS release. Compare new VM types against older VM types in pricing, so, that you are able to deploy VMs with the best price/performance ratio
5.	Check [here](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html#categories=Microsoft%20Azure) for new HANA certified SKUs in Azure and compare pricing with the ones you planned and evewntually change to get the units with better price performance ration 
6.	Adapt your deployment scripts to leverage new VM types and incorporate new features of Azure you want to use
7.	After deployment of the infrastructure, test and evaluate the network latency between SAP aplication layer VM and DBMS VM according to SAP support note [#500235](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/500235) and SAP support note [#1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926/E). Evaluate the results against network latency guidance of SAP support note [#1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926/E). The network latency should be in the moderate and good range. Exceptions apply to traffic between VMs and HANA Large Instance units as documented [here](#1100926](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1100926/E). Make sure that none of the restrictions mentioned in [Considerations for Azure Virtual Machines DBMS deployment for SAP workload](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/dbms_guide_general#azure-network-considerations) and [SAP HANA infrastructure configurations and operations on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-vm-operations) apply to your deployment
8.	Perform all the other checks as listed in the Proof of Concepts phase before applying workload
9.	As workload applies, record the resource consumption of those systems in Azure and compare with the records you got from your own platform. Adjust VM sizing of future deployments if you see that you have larger differences. Keep in mind that in case of downsizing, storage and network bandwidths of a VM will be reduced as well:
	1.	[Sizes for Windows virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). 
	2.	[Sizes for Linux virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) 
10.	Work on system copy functionality and processes. Goal is to make it easy for you to copy a development system or a test system, so, that project teams can get new systems fast. Consider [SAP LaMa](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/ATopics/SAP+Landscape+Management+%28SAP+LaMa%29+at+a+Glance) as a tool performing such tasks.
11.	Optimize and hone your team's Azure role based accesses, permissions and processes in order to make sure that you have a separation of duty on the one side. On the other side, you want to have all teams enabled to perform their tasks in the Azure infrastructure.
12.	Exercise, test and document high-availability and disaster recovery procedures to enable your staff to execute such tasks. Identify shortcomings and adapt new Azure functionality that you are integrating
