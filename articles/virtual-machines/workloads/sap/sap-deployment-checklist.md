#SAP workload on Azure planning and deployment checklist 

This checklist is designed for customers moving their to SAP NetWeaver, S/4HANA and Hybris applications to Azure Infrastructure as a Service.  This checklist should be reviewed together with a customer and SAP partner during the duration of of the project. it is important that a lot of the checks are conducted at the beginning of the project and in the planning phase. Once the deployment is done, elementary changes on deployed Azure infrastructure or SAP software releases can become complex. Review this checklist at key waypoints throughout a project.  Small problems can be detected before they become large problems and sufficient time is exists to re-engineer and test any necessary changes. The checklist in no ways claims to be complete. Dependent on your individual situation, there might be many more checks that need to be conducted. 

The checklist assembled does not include tasks that are independent of Azure.  Example: SAP application Interfaces change during a move to Azure Public Cloud or to a hosting provider.  Nothing specific to Azure will normally change and the SAP partner should normally handle validation of tasks that not Azure specific.  

This checklist can also be used for deployed customers. New features such as Write Accelerator, Availability Zones and new VM types may have been added since a customer deployed.  It is therefore useful to review the checklist periodically with large customers to ensure they are aware of new features in the platform. 

##Project preparation and planning phase
In this phase a migration of workload to Azure is planned. The minimum set of entities and items discussed and defined list like:

1. High Level Design Document – this document should contain: should contain:
	1. The current inventory of SAP components and applications and target application inventory on Azure
	2. A high level solution architecture
	3. Decision on Azure regions to deploy into. For a list of Azure regions, check the [Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/regions/). For services available in each of the Azure regions  check the article [products available per region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
	4. Networking architecture to connect from on-premise into Azure. As a start make yourself familiar with the [Virtual Datacenter blueprint for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/vdc/)
	5. Security principles for running high business impact data in Azure. For reading material start with [Azure Security Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/)
2.	Technical Design Document – that contains:
	1.	A solution block diagram 
	2.	Sizing of compute, storage and networking components in Azure. For SAP sizing of Azure VMs consult SAP support note [#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533) 
	3.	Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery architecture
	4.	Detailed OS, DB, Kernel and SAP support pack versions. it is not a given that any OS release that is supported by SAP NetWeaver or  S/4HANA is supported on Azure VMs. Same is true for DBMS releases. It is mandatory that the following sources get checked in order to align and if necessary upgrade SAP releases, DBMS releases or OS releases in order to be in a SAP and Azure supported window. It is mandatory that you are within SAP and Azure supported release combinations to get full support by SAP and Microsoft. If necessary you need to plan for upgrading some of the software components. More details on supported SAP, OS and DBMS software is documented in these locations:
		1.	SAP support note [#1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533). This note defines the minimum OS releases supported on Azure VMs. It also defines minimum database releases required for most non-HANA database. The note also presents the SAP sizing of the different SAP supported Azure VMs.
		2.	SAP support note [#2039619](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2039619). The note defines the Oracle support matrix on Azure
		3.	SAP support note [#2235581](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2235581) to get the support matrix for SAP HANA on the different OS releases
		4.	SAP HANA supported Azure VMs and [HANA Large Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture) are listed [here](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html#categories=Microsoft%20Azure)
		5.	[SAP Product Availability Matrix](https://support.sap.com/en/)
		6.	Other SAP notes for other SAP specific products	 
	5.	We recommend strict 3-Tier designs for SAP production systems. Combining ASCS + APP servers on the same VM is generally not recommended.  Servers hosting /sapmnt resources not to be used as File Servers for Interfaces or other purposes.    
3.	Customer/Partner should create an inventory of all SAP interfaces (SAP and non-SAP). 
4.	Design of Foundation Services Design - these would include items like
	1.	Active Directory and DSN design
	2.	Network topology within Azure and assignment of different SAP systems
	3.	[Role based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) structure for different teams in Azure
	3.	Resource Group topology 
	4.	Tagging strategy
	5.	Naming Convention for VMs and other infrastructure components and/or logical names
5.	Microsoft Premier Support Contract – identify MS Technical Account Manager (TAM). for support requirements by SAP read SAP support note [#2015553](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2015553) 
6.	Define number of Azure subscriptions and core quota for the different subscriptions. [Open support requests to increase quotas of Azure subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-supportability/resource-manager-core-quotas-request) as necessary 
7.	Define a regular design and deployment review cadence between you as customer, systme integrator, Microsoft and other involved parties 
 
##Pilot Phase (Optional) 
the pilot can run before or in parallel to project planning and preparation. The phase can also be used to test approaches and design made in the planning and preparation phase. the pilot phase can be stretched to a real proof of concepts.
