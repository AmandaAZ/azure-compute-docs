# OS backup and restore for Type II SKUs of Revision 3 stamps

This document describes the steps to perform an operating system file level backup and restore for the **Type II  SKUs** of the HANA Large Instances of Revision 3. 

>[!Important]
> **This article does not apply to Type II SKU deployments in Revision 4 HANA Large Instance stamps.** Boot LUNS of Type II HANA Large Instance units which are deployed in Revision 4 HANA Large Instance stamps can be backed up with storage snapshots as this is the case with Type I SKUs already in Revision 3 stamps


>[!NOTE]
> * The OS backup scripts uses xfsdump utility.  
> * This document supports complete Root filesystem backup and **no incremental** backups
> * Do ensure that while taking backups, there are no files being written actively to the system for which you will need a backup, since while the system is being backed up and there is a backup being performed it might not get updated in the backup.


## How to take a manual backup?

To perform a manual backup :

* Install the backup tool 
   ```
   zypper in xfsdump
   ```

* Create a backup 
   ```
   xfsdump -l 0 -f /data1/xfs_dump /
   ```

   The following screen show shows the sample manual backup:

* Save a copy of backup in NFS volumes as well, in the scenario where data1 partition also gets corrupted.
   ```
   cp /data1/xfs_dump /nfs_vol/
   ```

* For excluding regular directories and files from dump, please tag files with chattr
   * chattr -R +d directory
   * chattr +d file
   * Run xfsdump with “-e” option
   * Note, It is not possible to exclude nfs filesystems [ntfs]




## How to restore a backup?

>[!NOTE]
> * This step requires engaging Microsoft team.
> * We will be restoring the complete filesystem:

* Mount OS iso on the system 

* Enter rescue mode

* Mount data1 (or nfs volume, wherever the dump is stored) partition in read write mode
   ```
   mount -o rw /dev/md126p4 /mnt1
   ```
* Mount Root in read write mode
   ```
   mount -o rw /dev/md126p2 /mnt2
   ```
* Restore Filesystem 
   ```
   xfsrestore -f /mnt1/xfs_dump /mnt2
   ```
   ![how](media/HowToHLI/OSBackupTypeIISKUs/restore_screenshot.PNG)
* Reboot the system
   ```
   reboot
   ```

## Post Restore check

* Ensure the system has complete attributes restored.
   * Network is up
   * NFS volumes are mounted
* Ensure RAID is configured, please replace with your RAID device
   ```
   mdadm -D /dev/md126
   ```
   ![how](media/HowToHLI/OSBackupTypeIISKUs/RAID_status.PNG)

* Ensure that RAID disks are synced and the configuration is in a clean state.
   * RAID disks take sometime in syncing and for the initial few minutes it will sync before it is 100% synced.

* Start HANA DB
   ```
   su - sidadm
   HDB start
   ```
* Ensure HANA comes up and there are no errors
   ```
   hdbinfo
   ```
