# HB-series preview

HB-series VMs are in Preview for external customers starting December 2018. This document aims to provide the following to help customers during Preview:

- Technical detail
- How to’s & best practices
- Performance expectations
- Known issues


Please report all issues through standard Microsoft support channels. When opening support tickets, we strongly encourage specifying that your issue is an HPC matter, and CC-ing **AzureHPCFeedback@service.microsoft.com** and your primary Azure point of contact.

## Disclaimer

Preview access to HB-series VMs should be used for non-production purposes only. This is a time for the Azure HPC team and its HPC customers to conduct benchmarking, POC exercises, and cluster hardening. In more traditional terms, Preview on Azure is similar to “friendly user mode” on an HPC cluster.

During preview, Azure reserves the right to make changes to the cluster, including maintenance events on short notice. 

The Azure support teams will provide as much clear communication as early as possible about changes, known issues, and pending cluster maintenance.

For technical troubleshooting, please share the following details with the Azure HPC team:

- SubscriptionID
- ResourceGroup
- VMnames
- Approximate time when the issue occurred

Please also keep any VMs exhibiting a suspected performance or reliability concern deployed.

Thank you for requesting access to the preview of HB-series VMs for HPC. We’re excited to deliver this capability to HPC users and are eager for your feedback.
