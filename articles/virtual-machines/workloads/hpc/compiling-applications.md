# Compiling applications 

The AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC) compiler system offers a high level of advanced optimizations, multi-threading, and processor support that includes global optimization, vectorization, inter-procedural analyses, loop transformations, and code generation.  AOCC compiler binaries are suitable for Linux systems having GNU C Library (glibc) version 2.17 and above. The compiler suite consists of a C/C++ compiler (clang), a Fortran compiler (Flang) and a Fortran front end to Clang (Dragon Egg).


## Clang 
Clang is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler handling preprocessing, parsing, optimization, code generation, assembly, and linking. 
Clang supports the  `-march=znver1` flag to enable best code generation and tuning for AMD’s Zen based x86 architecture.


## Flang
The Flang compiler is a recent addition to the AOCC suite (added April 2018) and is currently in pre-release for developers to download and test. Based on Fortran 2008, AMD extends the github version of Flang  (https://github.com/flangcompiler/flang). The Flang compiler supports all Clang compiler options and an additional number of Flang-specific compiler options.


## DragonEgg
DragonEgg is a gcc plugin that replaces GCC’s optimizers and code generators with those from the LLVM project. DragonEgg that comes with AOCC works with gcc-4.8.x, has been tested for x86-32/x86-64 targets and has been successfully used on various Linux platforms.


GFortran is the actual frontend for Fortran programs responsible for preprocessing, parsing, and semantic analysis generating the GCC GIMPLE intermediate representation (IR). DragonEgg is a GNU plugin, plugging into GFortran compilation flow. It implements the GNU plugin API. With the plugin architecture, DragonEgg becomes the compiler driver, driving the different phases of compilation.  After following the download and installation instructions, Dragon Egg can be invoked using: 

```bash
$ gfortran [gFortran flags] 
   -fplugin=/path/AOCC-1.2-Compiler/AOCC-1.2-     
   FortranPlugin/dragonegg.so [plugin optimization flags]     
   -c xyz.f90 $ clang -O3 -lgfortran -o xyz xyz.o $./xyz
```
   
## PGI Compiler
PGI Community Edition ver. 17 is confirmed to work with AMD EPYC. A PGI-compiled version of STREAM does deliver full memory bandwidth of the platform. The newer Community Edition 18.10 (Nov 2018) should likewise work well. Below is sample CLI to compiler optimally with the Intel Compiler:

```bash
pgcc $(OPTIMIZATIONS_PGI) $(STACK) -DSTREAM_ARRAY_SIZE=800000000 stream.c -o stream.pgi
```

## Intel Compiler
Intel Compiler ver. 18 is confirmed to work with AMD EPYC. Below is sample CLI to compiler optimally with the Intel Compiler.

```bash
icc -o stream.intel stream.c -DSTATIC -DSTREAM_ARRAY_SIZE=800000000 -mcmodel=large -shared-intel -Ofast –qopenmp
```

## GCC Compiler 
For HPC, AMD recommends GCC compiler 7.3 or newer. Older versions, such as 4.8.5 included with RHEL/CentOS 7.4, are not recommend. GCC 7.3, and newer, will deliver significantly higher performance on HPL, HPCG, and DGEMM tests.

```bash
gcc $(OPTIMIZATIONS) $(OMP) $(STACK) $(STREAM_PARAMETERS) stream.c -o stream.gcc
```
