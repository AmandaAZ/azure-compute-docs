# HPC on HB-series and HC-series VMs

These pages cover recommended practices, observed patterns, and solutions to get started with High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads on Azure's H, HB, and HC-series virtual machines.

For a higher level, architectural view running HPC workloads, see [High Performance Computing (HPC) on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/topics/high-performance-computing/).

If you're looking for detailed specifications of H, HB, or HC-series VMs, see [High performance compute VM sizes](./linux/sizes-hpc.md).
