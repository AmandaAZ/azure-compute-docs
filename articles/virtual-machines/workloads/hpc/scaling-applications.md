# Scaling applications

At this time, the following is recommended for optimal application scaling efficiency, performance, and consistency:

- Pin processes to cores 0-59 using a sequential pinning approach (as opposed to an auto-balance approach). 
- Binding by Numa/Core/HwThread is better than default binding.
- For hybrid parallel applications (OpenMP+MPI), use 4 threads and 1 MPI rank per CCX.
- For pure MPI applications, experiment with 1-4 MPI ranks per CCX for optimal performance.
- Some applications with extreme sensitivity to memory bandwidth may benefit from using a reduced number of cores per CCX. For these applications, using 3 or 2 cores per CCX may reduce memory bandwidth contention and yield higher real-world performance or more consistent scalability. MPI Allreduce, in particular, may benefit from this.
- For significantly larger scale runs, it is recommended to use UD or hybrid RC+UD transports. Many MPI libraries/runtime libraries do this internally (like UCX or MVAPICH2). Please check your transport configurations for large scale runs.
