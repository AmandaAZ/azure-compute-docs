# Oracle on Azure

There are multiple Microsoft Azure offerings for running and managing your Oracle systems. These offerings range from traditional Azure Virtual Machines, top-level Azure services, to tools that integrate with other Azure services or external products. 

## Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines 

The Oracle on Azure virtual machines offering provides multiple options for running, managing, and monitoring Oracle workloads on Azure.  

For more information, see the [Oracle workloads on Azure Virtual machine](oracle-overview.md) documentation. 

## Oracle Database@Azure

In addition to the capabilities of Oracle on Azure virtual machines, Microsoft offers Oracle Database@Azure, which gives customers direct access to Oracle database services running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and deployed in Microsoft Azure datacenters.  

Oracle Database@Azure delivers all the performance, scale, and workload availability advantages of Oracle Database on OCI with the security, flexibility, and best-in-class services of Microsoft Azure.
