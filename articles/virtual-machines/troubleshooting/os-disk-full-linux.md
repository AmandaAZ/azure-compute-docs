# Issues with a full OS disk on a Linux virtual machine

When the OS disk of a Linux virtual machine (VM) becomes full, this can cause problems with the proper operation of the VM.

## Symptom

When you try to create a new file, you receive this message:

```
username@AZUbuntu1404:~$ touch new 
touch: cannot touch “new”: No space left on device 
username@AZUbuntu1404:~$
```

Multiple daemons then indicate that they are not able to create temporary files during the boot session.

```
ERROR:IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device: '/var/lib/waagent/events/1474306860983232.tmp' 
    
OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device: '/var/lib/cloud/data/tmpDZCq0g'
```
	
## Cause

There are several reasons why this error message can occur:

1. The disk could be full.
1. The filesystem might have run out of iNodes.
1. The data disk mounted over an existing directory might be hiding files.
1. The files that are opened by a process and then deleted.

## Solution

### Process Overview:

1. Create and access a Repair VM.
1. Free space on disk.
1. Enable serial console and memory dump collection.
1. Rebuild the VM.

> [!NOTE]
> When encountering this error, the Guest OS is not operational. Troubleshoot this issue in offline mode to resolve this issue.

### Create and Access a Repair VM

1. Use steps 1-3 of the [VM Repair Commands](./repair-windows-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md) to prepare a Repair VM.
1. Using Remote Desktop Connection, connect to the Repair VM.

### Free Up Space on the disk

To solve the issue:

- Resize the disk up to 1 TB if it is not already at the maximum size of 1 TB.
- Perform a disk cleanup.
- De-fragment the drive.

1. Check if the disk is full. If the disk size is below 1 TB, expand it up to a maximum of 1 TB [using PowerShell](../windows/expand-os-disk.md).
1. If the disk is already 1 TB, you will need to perform a disk cleanup.
   1. Use the [Disk Cleanup tool](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026616/windows-10-disk-cleanup) to free up space.
1. Once resizing and clean-up are finished, de-fragment the drive using the following command:

   ```
   defrag <LETTER ASSIGN TO THE OS DISK>: /u /x /g
   ```

Depending upon the level of fragmentation, de-fragmentation could take several hours.

### Enable the Serial Console and memory dump collection

**Recommended**: Before you rebuild the VM, enable the Serial Console and memory dump collection by running the following script:

1. Open an elevated command prompt session as an Administrator.
1. Run the following commands:

   **Enable the Serial Console**:

   ```
   bcdedit /store <VOLUME LETTER WHERE THE BCD FOLDER IS>:\boot\bcd /ems {<BOOT LOADER IDENTIFIER>} ON 
   bcdedit /store <VOLUME LETTER WHERE THE BCD FOLDER IS>:\boot\bcd /emssettings EMSPORT:1 EMSBAUDRATE:115200
   ```

1. Verify that the free space on the OS disk is larger than the memory size (RAM) on the VM.

   If there's not enough space on the OS disk, change the location where the memory dump file will be created, and refer that location to any data disk attached to the VM that has enough free space. To change the location, replace **%SystemRoot%** with the drive letter of the data disk, such as **F:**, in the following commands.

   Suggested configuration to enable OS Dump:

    **Load the broken OS Disk:**

   ```
   REG LOAD HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM <VOLUME LETTER OF BROKEN OS DISK>:\windows\system32\config\SYSTEM 
   ```

   **Enable on ControlSet001**:

   ```
   REG ADD "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\CrashControl" /v CrashDumpEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f 
   REG ADD "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\CrashControl" /v DumpFile /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP" /f 
   REG ADD "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\CrashControl" /v NMICrashDump /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
   ```

   **Enable on ControlSet002**:

   ```
   REG ADD "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\CrashControl" /v CrashDumpEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f 
   REG ADD "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\CrashControl" /v DumpFile /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP" /f 
   REG ADD "HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\CrashControl" /v NMICrashDump /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
   ```

   **Unload Broken OS Disk**:

   ```
   REG UNLOAD HKLM\BROKENSYSTEM
   ```

### Rebuild the VM

Use [step 5 of the VM Repair Commands](./repair-windows-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md#repair-process-example) to rebuild the VM.
