# Create a Linux virtual machine in an availability zone with the Azure portal

Azure virtual machines can be created through the Azure portal. This method provides a browser-based user interface for creating and configuring virtual machines and all related resources. This article steps through creating a virtual machine in an availability zone (preview). You learn how to:

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create SSH key pair

You need an SSH key pair to complete this quick start. If you have an existing SSH key pair, this step can be skipped.

From a Bash shell, run this command and follow the on-screen directions. The command output includes the file name of the public key file. Copy the contents of the public key file to the clipboard.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

## Log in to Azure 

Log in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.

## Create virtual machine

1. Click the **New** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

2. Select **Compute**, and then select **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS**. 

3. Enter the virtual machine information. For **Authentication type**, select **SSH public key**. When pasting in your SSH public key, take care to remove any leading or trailing white space. When complete, click **OK**.
