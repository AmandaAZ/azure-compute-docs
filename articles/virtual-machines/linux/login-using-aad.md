# Login to an Azure Linux virtual machine using Azure AD authentication *[Preview]*
This article shows you how to log in to an Azure Linux virtual machine using Azure AD authentication.

## Benefits of using Azure AD authentication
There are many benefits of using Azure AD authentication to log in to Azure Linux virtual machines.

1. **Improved security:** This approach has many security benefits:
  - You can use your corporate AD credentials to log in to Azure Linux VMs. There is no need to create local administrator accounts and manage credential lifetime.
  - By reducing your reliance on local administrator accounts, you do not need to worry about credential loss/theft, users configuring weak credentials etc.
  - The password complexity and password lifetime policies configured for your Azure AD directory help secure Linux VMs as well.
  - The VM is not susceptible to password brute force attacks on local administrator accounts.
  - You can configure multiple factor authentication or conditional access control policies to further secure login to Azure virtual machines.

2. **Seamless collaboration:** Using RBAC roles you can specify who has access to a given VM, as a regular user or with administrator privileges. When users join or leave your team, you can easily update the RBAC policy for the VM to grant or deny access as appropriate. This experience is much simpler than having to scrub VMs to remove unnecessary SSH public keys. When employees leave your organization, they no longer have access to your resources.


## Supported Azure Linux distributions
The following Linux distributions are supported for this functionality:

| Distribution | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Ubuntu Server | Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu Server 17.10 |

## Supported Azure regions
The preview of this feature is available only in the following Azure regions:
1. South Central US

>[!IMPORTANT]
> To use this preview, you must provision your test virtual machine only in a supported Azure region listed above.
>

## Provision a Linux virtual machine
Provision a new Azure Linux virtual machine using either the Azure portal or Azure CLI. Ensure that you pick a Linux distribution and version supported by the preview. Also pick the ‘South Central US’ region when provisioning your virtual machine.
More information – provision an Azure Linux virtual machine using:
•	[Azure portal](quick-create-portal.md)
•	[Azure CLI](quick-create-cli.md)
•	[Azure PowerShell](quick-create-powershell.md)


## Setup Azure PowerShell
Install Azure PowerShell by following the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps?view=azuresmps-4.0.0. If you have an older version of Azure PowerShell, follow the instructions to update it.

When you are done, type the following command to sign-in to your Azure account.

```PowerShell
Add-AzureRmAccount
```


### Install the Azure AD login VM extension
Type the following PowerShell command to install the Azure AD VM login extension on the Linux virtual machine. Replace ```VM_NAME```, ```RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME```, and ```LOCATION``` as appropriate for your deployed virtual machine.

```PowerShell
Set-AzureRmVMExtension -Publisher “Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.LinuxSSH.Edp” `
-ExtensionType “AADLoginForLinux” -ResourceGroupName "RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME" `
-VMName "VM_NAME" -ExtensionName "AADLoginForLinux" `
-Location "South Central US" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.0"
```

>[!NOTE]
> Only the 'South Central US' Azure region is supported during the preview.
>

If the command executes successfully, the VM extension is installed on the virtual machine. You see a ```StatusCode``` value of 'OK' in the PowerShell console.

In the Azure portal, you should see the virtual machine extension installed successfully on the virtual machine.

## Configure RBAC policy for the Linux virtual machine
Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy determines who can log in to the virtual machine. Two new RBAC roles are used to authorize VM login:
1. **Virtual Machine Administrator Login**: Users with this role assigned can log in to an Azure virtual machine with Windows Administrator or Linux root user privileges.
2. **Virtual Machine User Login**: Users with this role assigned can log in to an Azure virtual machine with regular user privileges.

To configure RBAC policy for the Linux virtual machine:

1. Navigate to the [virtual machines page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines) in the Azure portal.
2. Click the Linux VM for which you want to configure RBAC policy.
3. In the left-hand navigation pane, click **Access control (IAM)**.
4. Click the **Add** button.
5. In the **Add permissions** page, click the **Role** dropdown.
6. To configure the role, which allows users to log in to the VM with 'root' privileges, select **Virtual Machine Administrator Login**.
7. To configure the role, which allows users to log in to the VM with regular user privileges, select **Virtual Machine User Login**.
8. In the **Assign access to** dropdown, select **Azure AD user, group, or application**.
9. In the **Select** box, search for the user or group to which you would like to assign this role.
10. After selecting all desired users or groups, click the **Save** button.

### More information - configure Azure RBAC policy
For more information on how to use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources, see:
* [Configure RBAC using Azure portal](../../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md)
* [Configure RBAC using Azure PowerShell](../../active-directory/role-based-access-control-manage-access-powershell.md)


## Require multi-factor authentication to login to the virtual machine
You can configure Azure AD to require multi-factor authentication for a specific user to sign in to the Linux virtual machine. 
More information – [Getting started with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-cloud).


## Log in to the Linux virtual machine
You can now log in to the Azure Linux virtual machine using your Azure AD credentials. Open an SSH prompt and type the following:

```
ssh -l admin@contosomfg.onmicrosoft.com <VM_IP>
```
Replace VM_IP above with the IP address of the Linux virtual machine to which you’d like to connect over SSH.

You will be prompted to sign in to Azure AD with a one-time use code at [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin). Navigate to the page and enter the one-time use code you see on the SSH console. Authenticate by providing your credentials. If multi-factor authentication is configured for your account, you will be prompted to complete a second factor of authentication.

When you are successfully signed in, return to the SSH prompt and press the ‘Enter’ key. You should be signed in to the Azure Linux virtual machine.

## Troubleshoot sign-in issues
If you see the following error on your SSH prompt, ensure you have configured RBAC policies for the virtual machine to allow the user to sign in. Specifically, ensure that the user has been granted the ‘Virtual Machine User Login’ role for the virtual machine.

```
login as: admin@contosomfg.onmicrosoft.com
Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code FJX327AXD to authenticate. Press ENTER when ready.
Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
Access denied:  to sign-in you be assigned a role with action 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/login/action', for example 'Virtual Machine User Login'
Access denied
```
