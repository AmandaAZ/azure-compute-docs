# Virtual machine vCPU quotas

The vCPU quotas for virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets are arranged in two tiers for each subscription, in each region. The first tier is the Total Regional vCPUs, and the second tier is the various VM size family cores such as Standard D Family vCPUs. Any time a new VM is deployed the vCPUs for the newly deployed VM must not exceed the vCPU quota for the specific VM size family or the total regional vCPU quota. If either of those quotas are exceeded, then the VM deployment will not be allowed. There is also a quota for the overall number of virtual machines in the region. The details on each of these quotas can be seen in the Usage + quota section of the **Subscription** page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), or you can query for the values using Azure CLI.

## Check usage

You can check your quota usage using [az vm list-usage](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_list_usage).

```azurecli-interactive
az vm list-usage --location "East US"
[
  â€¦
  {
    "currentValue": 4,
    "limit": 260,
    "name": {
      "localizedValue": "Total Regional vCPUs",
      "value": "cores"
    }
  },
  {
    "currentValue": 4,
    "limit": 10000,
    "name": {
      "localizedValue": "Virtual Machines",
      "value": "virtualMachines"
    }
  },
  {
    "currentValue": 1,
    "limit": 2000,
    "name": {
      "localizedValue": "Virtual Machine Scale Sets",
      "value": "virtualMachineScaleSets"
    }
  },
  {
    "currentValue": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "name": {
      "localizedValue": "Standard B Family vCPUs",
      "value": "standardBFamily"
    }
  },
```
