# Azure Storage encryption for data at rest

Server Side Encryption is enabled for all new and existing managed disks and cannot be disabled. Because your data is secured by default, you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of Azure Storage encryption. Encryption protects your data and to help you to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit [AES encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption is similar to BitLocker encryption on Windows.

Managed disks are encrypted regardless of their disk type. All Azure Storage redundancy options support encryption, and all copies of a storage account are encrypted. All object metadata is also encrypted.

Encryption does not affect performance. There is no additional cost for Azure Storage encryption.

For more information about the cryptographic modules underlying Azure Storage encryption, see [Cryptography API: Next Generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/seccng/cng-portal).

## About encryption key management

You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your managed disk, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. If you choose to manage encryption with your own keys, you can specify a *customer-managed key* to use for encrypting and decrypting all data in the storage account. A customer-managed key is used to encrypt all data in your managed disk.

The following sections describe each of the options for key management in greater detail.

## Microsoft-managed keys

By default, your managed disk uses Microsoft-managed encryption keys.

## Customer-managed keys

You can choose to manage Azure Storage encryption at the level of each managed disk, with your own keys. When you specify a customer-managed key at the level of the managed disk, that key is used to encrypt and decrypt all data in the managed disk.  Customer-managed keys offer greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. You can also audit the encryption keys used to protect your data.

You must use Azure Key Vault to store your customer-managed keys. You can either create your own keys and store them in a key vault, or you can use the Azure Key Vault APIs to generate keys. The storage account and the key vault must be in the same region, but they can be in different subscriptions. For more information about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../../key-vault/key-vault-overview.md).

This diagram shows how Azure Storage uses Azure Active Directory and Azure Key Vault to make requests using the customer-managed key:

![Managed disks customer managed keys workflow](media/disk-encryption/customer-managed-keys-sse-managed-disks-workflow.png)

The following list explains the numbered steps in the diagram:

1. An Azure Key Vault admin creates key vault resources.
1. The key vault administrator either an import your RSA keys to AKV or generate new RSA keys in AKV. .
1. That administrator creates a disk encryption set, specifying an Azure Key Vault ID and a key URL.
1. When a disk encryption set is created, a managed identity is created in Azure active directory (AD).
1. The Azure key vault administrator then grants the managed identity permission to perform operations in the key vault.
1. Managed disks use the managed identity to send requests to the Azure Key Vault.
1. For read/write operations, requests are sent to Azure Key Vault to wrap and unwrap the encryption key in order to perform encryption and decryption operations.

To revoke access to customer-managed keys on the storage account, see [Azure Key Vault PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.keyvault/) and [Azure Key Vault CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/keyvault). Revoking access effectively blocks access to all data in the storage account, as the encryption key is inaccessible by Azure Storage.

### Setting up your Azure Key Vault

1.	Create an instance of Azure Key Vault and encryption key

```powershell
$keyVault = New-AzKeyVault -Name myKeyVaultName ` 
-ResourceGroupName myRGName ` 
-Location centraluseuap ` 
-EnableSoftDelete ` 
-EnablePurgeProtection 
 
$key = Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName ` 
-Name myKeyName ` 
-Destination Software `  
```

1.	Create an instance of a new resource type called as DiskEncryptionSet which represents a CMK. 

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName myRGName ` 
  -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramankumarlive/manageddiskscmkpreview/master/CreateDiskEncryptionSet.json" ` 
  -diskEncryptionSetName "myDiskEncryptionSet1" ` 
  -keyVaultId "/subscriptions/mySubscriptionId/resourceGroups/myRGName/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/myKeyVaultName" ` 
  -keyVaultKeyUrl "https://myKeyVaultName.vault.azure.net/keys/myKeyName/403445136dee4a57af7068cab08f7d42" ` 
  -region "WestCentralUS"
```

1.	Grant DataEncryptionSet resource access to the key vault

```powershell
$identity = Get-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName myDiskEncryptionSet1  
 
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy ` 
    -VaultName $keyVault.VaultName ` 
    -ObjectId $identity.Id ` 
    -PermissionsToKeys wrapkey,unwrapkey,get 
 
New-AzRoleAssignment ` 
    -ObjectId $identity.Id ` 
    -RoleDefinitionName "Reader" ` 
    -ResourceName $keyVault.VaultName ` 
    -ResourceType "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults" ` 
    -ResourceGroupName myRGName `  
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed keys rely on managed identities for Azure resources, a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you configure customer-managed keys, a managed identity is automatically assigned to your resources under the covers. If you subsequently move the subscription, resource group, or managed disk from one Azure AD directory to another, the managed identity associated with the storage account is not transferred to the new tenant, so customer-managed keys may no longer work. For more information, see **Transferring a subscription between Azure AD directories** in [FAQs and known issues with managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/known-issues.md#transferring-a-subscription-between-azure-ad-directories).  

## Azure Storage encryption versus disk encryption

With Azure Storage encryption, all Azure Storage accounts and the resources they contain are encrypted, including the page blobs that back Azure virtual machine disks. Additionally, Azure virtual machine disks may be encrypted with [Azure Disk Encryption](../../security/azure-security-disk-encryption-overview.md). Azure Disk Encryption uses industry-standard [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview) on Windows and [DM-Crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt) on Linux to provide operating system-based encryption solutions that are integrated with Azure Key Vault.
