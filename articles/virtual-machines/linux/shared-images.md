# Create a shared image gallery with the Azure CLI

A [Shared Image Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md) simplifies custom image sharing across your organization. Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. 

The Shared Image Gallery lets you share your custom VM images with others in your organization, within or across regions, within an AAD tenant. Choose which images you want to share, which regions you want to make them available in, and who you want to share them with. You can create multiple galleries so that you can logically group shared images. 

The gallery is a top-level resource that provides full role-based access control (RBAC). Images can be versioned, and you can choose to replicate each image version to a different set of Azure regions. The gallery only works with Managed Images.

The Shared Image Gallery feature has multiple resource types. We will be using or building these in this article:

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-shared-images-cli](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-shared-images-cli.md)]

## Using RBAC to share

You can share images across subscriptions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Any user that has read permissions to an image version, even across subscriptions, will be able to deploy a Virtual Machine using the image version.

For more information about how to share resources using RBAC, see [Manage access using RBAC and Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli).
