# Common terms

## VHDs

VHDs are virtual hard disks. In the azure space they can either be data or OS disks.

## IOPS

IOPS is number of requests that your application is sending to the storage disks in one second. An input/output operation could be read or write, sequential or random. OLTP applications like an online retail website need to process many concurrent user requests immediately. The user requests are insert and update intensive database transactions, which the application must process quickly. Therefore, OLTP applications require very high IOPS. Such applications handle millions of small and random IO requests. If you have such an application, you must design the application infrastructure to optimize for IOPS. In the later section, *Optimizing Application Performance*, we discuss in detail all the factors that you must consider to get high IOPS.

When you attach a premium storage disk to your high scale VM, Azure provisions for you a guaranteed number of IOPS as per the disk specification. For example, a P50 disk provisions 7500 IOPS. Each high scale VM size also has a specific IOPS limit that it can sustain. For example, a Standard GS5 VM has 80,000 IOPS limit.

## Throughput

Throughput or Bandwidth is the amount of data that your application is sending to the storage disks in a specified interval. If your application is performing input/output operations with large IO unit sizes, it requires high Throughput. Data warehouse applications tend to issue scan intensive operations that access large portions of data at a time and commonly perform bulk operations. In other words, such applications require higher Throughput. If you have such an application, you must design its infrastructure to optimize for Throughput. In the next section, we discuss in detail the factors you must tune to achieve this.

When you attach a premium storage disk to a high scale VM, Azure provisions Throughput as per that disk specification. For example, a P50 disk provisions 250 MB per second disk Throughput. Each high scale VM size also has as specific Throughput limit that it can sustain. For example, Standard GS5 VM has a maximum throughput of 2,000 MB per second. 

There is a relation between Throughput and IOPS as shown in the formula below.

Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal Throughput and IOPS values that your application requires. As you try to optimize one, the other also gets affected. In a later section, *Optimizing Application Performance*, we will discuss in more details about optimizing IOPS and Throughput.

## Latency

Latency is the time it takes an application to receive a single request, send it to the storage disks and send the response to the client. This is a critical measure of an application's performance in addition to IOPS and Throughput. The Latency of a premium storage disk is the time it takes to retrieve the information for a request and communicate it back to your application. Premium Storage provides consistent low latencies. If you enable ReadOnly host caching on premium storage disks, you can get much lower read latency. We will discuss Disk Caching in more detail in later section on *Optimizing Application Performance*.

When you are optimizing your application to get higher IOPS and Throughput, it will affect the Latency of your application. After tuning the application performance, always evaluate the Latency of the application to avoid unexpected high latency behavior.
