# Virtual machine isolation in Azure

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-isolation](../../../includes/virtual-machines-common-isolation.md)]

# Retiring D15_v2/DS15_v2 isolation on December 30, 2019
We recently announced the Preview of Azure Dedicated Host, which allows you to run your organization’s Linux and Windows virtual machines on single-tenant physical servers. We plan to fully replace isolated Azure VMs with Azure Dedicated Host. After <b>December 30, 2019</b>, the D15_v2/DS15_v2 Azure VMs may no longer be hardware isolated.

## How does this affect me?
After December 30, 2019, we will no longer provide an isolation guarantee for your D15_v2/DS15_v2 Azure virtual machines. 

## What actions should I take?
If hardware isolation is not important to you, there is no action you need to take. 

If isolation is important to you, before December 30, 2019, you would need to either:
•	Migrate your workload to Azure Dedicated Host Preview
•	Migrate to a D15i_v2 and DS15i_v2 Azure VM, to get the same price performance. This option is only available for pay-as-you-go and one-year reserved instance scenarios. 
•	Migrate your workload to another Azure isolated virtual machine. 

For details see below:

## Timeline

## FAQs
### Reserved Instances - Bill
### Q: I already purchased 1- or 3-year Reserved Instance for D15_v2 or Ds15_v2. How will the discount be applied to my VM usage?
**A**: All RIs purchased before the announcement date (tentative: 8/15) will automatically extend coverage to the new isolated VM series. 

| RI |	Instance Size Flexibility |	Benefit eligibility |	
| --- | --- | --- |
|	D15_v2 	|	Off 	|	D15_v2 and D15i_v2 |	
|	D15_v2 	|	On 	|	D15_v2 series and D15i_v2 will all receive the RI benefit. |	
|	D14_v2 	|	On 	|	D15_v2 series and D15i_v2 will all receive the RI benefit. |	
 
Likewise for Dsv2 series.
 
### Q: I want to purchase additional Reserved Instances for Dv2. Which one should I choose?
**A**: All RIs purchased after the announcement date will have the following behavior. 

| RI |	Instance Size Flexibility |	Benefit eligibility |	
| --- | --- | --- |
| D15_v2 | 	Off | 	D15_v2 only  
| D15_v2 | 	On | 	D15_v2 series will receive the RI benefit. The new D15i_v2 will not be eligible for RI benefit from this RI type. | 
| D15i_v2 | 	Off | D15i_v2 only |  
| D15i_v2 | 	On 	| D15i_v2 only | 
 
Instance Size Flexibility cannot be used to apply to any other sizes such as D2_v2, D4_v2, or D15_v2. 
Likewise, for Dsv2 series.  
 
### Q: Can I buy a new 3-year RI for D15i_v2 and DS15i_v2?
**A**: Unfortunately no, only 1-year RI is available for new purchase.
 
### Q: Can I move my existing D15_v2/DS15_v2 Reserve Instance to an isolated size Reserved Instance?
**A**: This is not necessary since the benefit will apply to both isolated and non-isolated sizes. But Azure will support changing existing D15_v2/DS15_v2 Reserved Instances to D15i_v2/DS15i_v2. For all other Dv2/Dsv2 Reserved Instances, use the existing Reserved Instance or buy new Reserved Instances for the isolated sizes.
 
### Miscellaneous
### Q: When are the other isolated sizes going to retire?
**A**: We will provide reminders 12 months in advance of the official decommissioning of the sizes.

### Q: Is there a downtime when my vm lands on a non-isolated hardware?
**A**: If you do not need isolation you do not need to take any action and you would not see any downtime.

### Q: Are there any cost changes for moving to a non-isolated virtual machine?
**A**: No 

### Q: Why am I not seeing the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes in the portal?
**A**: By default, all the existing customers of D/DS15_v2 should see these sizes. If you are a current D/DS15_v2 customer and looking for isolation, please whitelist yourself by filling this: </b>TBU</b>
Approval will take up to 48hours.

### Q: Why I am not seeing any quota for the new D/DS15i_v2 sizes?
**A**: Each customer is assigned the default quota according to the customer segment. If you are looking for more please see: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-manage-quotas#request-quota-increases 

### Q: What happen to my discounts? <b>TBU by Jason Marley<b>
**A**: Any customers who move from the existing meter to the new meter will keep all of their pricing discounts, or EA negotiated discounts that may be in effect on the current meters.
