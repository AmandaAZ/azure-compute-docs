# Enable host-based encryption

When you enable host-based encryption, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. For conceptual information on host-based encryption, as well as other managed disk encryption types, see [Server-side encryption of Azure managed disks](disk-encryption.md#encryption-at-vm-host)
