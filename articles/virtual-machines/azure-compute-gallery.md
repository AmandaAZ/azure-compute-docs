# Store and share resources in an Azure Compute Gallery

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

An Azure Compute Gallery helps you build structure and organization around your Azure resources, like images and [applications](vm-applications.md). An Azure Compute Gallery provides:

- Global replication.
- Versioning and grouping of resources for easier management.
- Highly available resources with Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) accounts in regions that support Availability Zones. ZRS offers better resilience against zonal failures.
- Premium storage support (Premium_LRS).
- Sharing to the community, across subscriptions, and between Active Directory (AD) tenants.
- Scaling your deployments with resource replicas in each region.

With a gallery, you can share your resources to everyone, or limit sharing to different users, service principals, or AD groups within your organization. Resources can be replicated to multiple regions, for quicker scaling of your deployments.

## Community Galleries (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Community Galleries is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service-level agreement, and we don't recommend it for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).


Community Galleries is a new capability in Azure Compute Gallery to support making public galleries, where you can make your images available to all Azure customers. When an gallery is marked as community-enabled, all images under the gallery become available to all Azure customers as a new resource type under Microsoft.Compute/communityGalleries. All Azure customers can see the galleries and use them to create VMs. Your original resources of the type `Microsoft.Compute/galleries` are still under your subscription, and private. You can continue to use it as you did before.

Only an owner of a subscription can enable their gallery to go Public to the community.

If you want to stop sharing a gallery publicly, you can update the gallery but making the gallery private will prevent existing virtual machine scale set users from scaling their resources


Community galleries don't support:
- encrypted images
- Image resources that aren't created in the same region as the gallery. For example, if you create a gallery in West US, the image definitions and image versions should be created in West US if you want to make them available during the public preview.
- [VM Applications](vm-applications.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not provide support for images in the Community Gallery.

## Images 

For more information about storing images in an Azure Compute Gallery, see [Store and share images in an Azure Compute Gallery](shared-image-galleries.md).

## VM apps

While you can create an image of a VM with apps pre-installed, you would need to update your image each time you have application changes. Separating your application installation from your VM images means thereâ€™s no need to publish a new image for every line of code change.

For more information about storing applications in an Azure Compute Gallery, see [VM Applications](vm-applications.md).


## Regional Support

All public regions can be target regions, but certain regions require that customers go through a request process in order to gain access. To request that a subscription is added to the allowlist for a region such as Australia Central or Australia Central 2, submit [an access request](/troubleshoot/azure/general/region-access-request-process)

## Limits 

There are limits, per subscription, for deploying resources using Azure Compute Galleries:
- 100 galleries, per subscription, per region
- 1,000 image definitions, per subscription, per region
- 10,000 image versions, per subscription, per region
- 10 image version replicas, per subscription, per region
- Any disk attached to the image must be less than or equal to 1TB in size

For more information, see [Check resource usage against limits](../networking/check-usage-against-limits.md) for examples on how to check your current usage.
 
## Scaling
Azure Compute Gallery allows you to specify the number of replicas you want to keep. This helps in multi-VM deployment scenarios as the VM deployments can be spread to different replicas reducing the chance of instance creation processing being throttled due to overloading of a single replica.

With Azure Compute Gallery, you can deploy up to a 1,000 VM instances in a virtual machine scale set. You can set a different replica count in each target region, based on the scale needs for the region. Since each replica is a copy of your resource, this helps scale your deployments linearly with each extra replica. While we understand no two resources or regions are the same, here's our general guideline on how to use replicas in a region:

- For every 20 VMs that you create concurrently, we recommend you keep one replica. For example, if you are creating 120 VMs concurrently using the same image in a region, we suggest you keep at least 6 replicas of your image.
- For each scale set you create concurrently, we recommend you keep one replica.

We always recommend that to over-provision the number of replicas due to factors like resource size, content and OS type.

## Make your resources highly available

[Azure Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-zone-redundant-storage-in-public-preview/) provides resilience against an Availability Zone failure in the region. With the general availability of Azure Compute Gallery, you can choose to store your images in ZRS accounts in regions with Availability Zones.

You can also choose the account type for each of the target regions. The default storage account type is Standard_LRS, but you can choose Standard_ZRS for regions with Availability Zones. For more information on regional availability of ZRS, see [Data redundancy](../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md).

![Graphic showing ZRS](./media/shared-image-galleries/zrs.png)

## Replication
Azure Compute Gallery also allows you to replicate your resources to other Azure regions automatically. Each image version can be replicated to different regions depending on what makes sense for your organization. One example is to always replicate the latest image in multi-regions while all older image versions are only available in 1 region. This can help save on storage costs.

The regions that a resource is replicated to can be updated after creation time. The time it takes to replicate to different regions depends on the amount of data being copied and the number of regions the version is replicated to. This can take a few hours in some cases. While the replication is happening, you can view the status of replication per region. Once the image replication is complete in a region, you can then deploy a VM or scale-set using that resource in the region.

## Explicit access

As the Azure Compute Gallery, definition, and version are all resources, they can be shared using the built-in native Azure RBAC controls. Using Azure RBAC you can share these resources to other users, service principals, and groups. You can even share access to individuals outside of the tenant they were created within. Once a user has access to the resource version, they can use it to deploy a VM or a Virtual Machine Scale Set.  Here is the sharing matrix that helps understand what the user gets access to:

| Shared with User     | Azure Compute Gallery | Image Definition | Image version |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Azure Compute Gallery | Yes                  | Yes          | Yes                  |
| Image Definition     | No                   | Yes          | Yes                  |

We recommend sharing at the Gallery level for the best experience. We do not recommend sharing individual image versions. For more information about Azure RBAC, see [Assign Azure roles](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

## Sharing to the community

Community Gallery

## Billing
There is no extra charge for using the Azure Compute Gallery service. You will be charged for the following resources:
- Storage costs of storing each replica. For images, the storage cost is charged as a snapshot and is based on the occupied size of the image version, the number of replicas of the image version and the number of regions the version is replicated to. 
- Network egress charges for replication of the first resource version from the source region to the replicated regions. Subsequent replicas are handled within the region, so there are no additional charges. 

For example, let's say you have an image of a 127 GB OS disk, that only occupies 10GB of storage, and one empty 32 GB data disk. The occupied size of each image would only be 10 GB. The image is replicated to 3 regions and each region has two replicas. There will be six total snapshots, each using 10GB. You will be charged the storage cost for each snapshot based on the occupied size of 10 GB. You will pay network egress charges for the first replica to be copied to the additional two regions. For more information on the pricing of snapshots in each region, see [Managed disks pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/). For more information on network egress, see [Bandwidth pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth/).
