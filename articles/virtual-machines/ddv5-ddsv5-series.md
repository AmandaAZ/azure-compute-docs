# Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series Virtual Machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core Turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz, [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html).


## Ddv5-series
The Ddv5 series virtual machines are based on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper-threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration. This custom processor can reach an all core Turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz and featues [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). The Ddv5 virtual machine sizes include high performance, large local SSD storage (up to 2,400 GiB) and provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (e.g., increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

The Ddv5 VM sizes offer a combination of vCPUs, memory, and temporary storage able to meet the requirements associated with most enterprise workloads, such as small-to-medium databases, low-to-medium traffic web servers, application servers and more.

You can attach Standard SSDs and Standard HDDs disk storage to these VMs. To use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk storage, select Ddsv5 VMs. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Ddsv5-series

The Ddsv5 series virtual machines are based on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a hyper-threaded configuration. This custom processor can reach an all core Turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz and features(https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). The Ddsv5 virtual machine sizes feature high performance, large local SSD storage (up to 2,400 GiB) and provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example., increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

The Ddsv5 VM sizes offer a combination of vCPUs, memory, and temporary storage able to meet the requirements associated with most enterprise workloads, such as small-to-medium databases, low-to-medium traffic web servers, application servers and more.

You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, and Premium SSDs disk storage to these VMs. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).
