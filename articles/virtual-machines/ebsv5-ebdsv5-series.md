# Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

 The new memory-optimized Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VM series delivers higher remote storage performance in each VM size than the Ev4 VM series. The increased remote storage performance of the Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VMs is ideal for storage throughput-intensive workloads, such as relational databases and data analytics applications.  

The Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5 VMs offer up to 120,000 IOPS and 4,000 MBps of remote disk storage throughput. They also include up to 504 GiB of RAM and local SSD storage (up to 2,400 GiB). This new VM series provides a 3X increase in remote storage performance of data-intensive workloads compared to prior VM generations and helps consolidate existing workloads on fewer VMs or smaller VM sizes while achieving potential cost savings. The Ebdsv5 series comes with a local disk and Ebsv5 is without a local disk. Please note that Standard SSDs and Standard HDDs disk storage are not supported in the Ebv5 series. 

The Ebsv5 and Ebdsv5-series runs on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Ice Lake) processors in a hyper-threaded configuration and are ideal for various memory-intensive enterprise applications and feature up to 504 GiB of RAM, [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology 2.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html), and [Intel&reg; Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html). They also support [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html).  


## Ebsv5-series

Ebsv5-series sizes run on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Ice Lake). These virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from high remote storage performance but with no local SSD storage. Ebsv5-series VMs feature Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology. Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.

## Ebdsv5-series

Ebdsv5-series sizes run on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Ice Lake) processors. The Ebdsv5 virtual machine sizes feature up to 504 GiB of RAM, in addition to fast and large local SSD storage (up to 2,400 GiB). These virtual machines are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications and applications that benefit from high remote storage performance, low latency, high-speed local storage. Remote Data disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
