# ECesv5 and ECedsv5-series confidential VMs

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs 

The ECesv5-series and ECedsv5-series are [confidential VMs](../confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview.md) for use in Confidential Computing. 

These confidential VMs use AMD's third-Generation EPYC<sup>TM</sup> 7763v processor in a multi-threaded configuration with up to 256 MB L3 cache. These processors can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.5 GHz. Both series offer Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). SEV-SNP provides hardware-isolated VMs that protect data from other VMs, the hypervisor, and host management code. Confidential VMs offer hardware-based VM memory encryption. These series also offer OS disk pre-encryption before VM provisioning with different key management solutions. 

## ECesv5-series

ECesv5-series VMs offer a combination of vCPU and memory for most production workloads. These VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads where you don't need a local temporary disk. For more information, see the [FAQ for Azure VM sizes with no local temporary disk](azure-vms-no-temp-disk.yml). 

This series supports Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. Billing for disk storage and VMs is separate. To estimate your costs, use the [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

> [!NOTE]
> There are some [pricing differences based on your encryption settings](../confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview.md#encryption-pricing-differences) for confidential VMs.
