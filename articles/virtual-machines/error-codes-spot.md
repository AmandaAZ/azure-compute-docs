Here are some possible error codes you could receive when using spot VMs and scale sets.

| Key | Message | Description |
|-----|---------|
| EvictionPolicyCanBeSetOnlyOnLowPriorityVirtualMachines | Eviction policy can be set only on spot Virtual Machines. | This VM is not a spot VM, so you can't set the eviction policy. |
| LowPriVMNotSupportedInAvailabilitySet | spot Virtual Machine is not supported in Availability Set. | You need to choose to either use a spot VM or use a VM in an availability set, you can't choose both. |
| VariablePricingFeatureNotEnabledForSubscription | Subscription not enabled with variable pricing feature. | You need to have a subscription that supports spot VMs and you need to have enabled the feature for the public preview. |
| VMPriorityCannotBeApplied | The specified priority value '{0}' cannot be applied to the Virtual Machine '{1}' since no priority was specified when the Virtual Machine was created. | You need to specify the priority when the VM is created.  |
| VariablePriceGreaterThanProvidedMaxPrice | Cannot create this Virtual Machine since the provided max price is lower than the current variable price {0} for spot VM size {1}. | Select a higher max price. For more information, see pricing information for [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) or [Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/).|
| MaxPriceValueInvalid | Invalid max price value. The only supported values for max price are -1 or a decimal greater than zero. Max price value of -1 indicates the spot virtual machine will not be evicted for price reasons. | Enter a valid max price.

| MoveResourcesWithLowPriorityVMNotSupported | The move resources request contains a spot virtual machine. This is currently not supported. Please check the error details for virtual machine IDs.  | You cannot move spot VMs. |
| MoveResourcesWithLowPriorityVmssNotSupported | The Move resources request contains a spot virtual machine scale set. This is currently not supported. Please check the error details for virtual machine scale set IDs.| You cannot move spot instances. |
| EphemeralOSDisksNotSupportedForSpotVMs | Ephemeral OS disks are not supported for Spot VMs. | You need to use a standard OS disk for VMs that use spot pricing. |
