# 'HC' sub-family storage optimized VM size series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The 'HC' family of VM size series are one of Azure's high-performance computing (HPC) optimized VM instances. They're designed for compute-intensive workloads that require substantial CPU power, such as genomic sequencing, engineering simulations, and financial modeling. Equipped with high-performance Intel Xeon Scalable processors and fast memory, HC-series VMs offer exceptional computational capabilities and memory bandwidth, making them ideal for applications that demand intense processing power to handle complex calculations and massive data sets efficiently. This makes them particularly well-suited for sectors like healthcare, finance, and engineering, where rapid data processing and simulation accuracy are critical for advanced research and development.

## Workloads and use cases

**Genomic Sequencing:** HC-series VMs provide the computational power needed for genomic sequencing, enabling researchers to process and analyze large genetic datasets quickly.

**Engineering Simulations:** Ideal for running complex simulations in fields such as automotive, aerospace, and mechanical engineering. These simulations often include finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

**Financial Modeling:** These VMs can handle the high demands of financial applications, including risk analysis and quantitative simulations, which require massive computational resources to execute many calculations quickly.

**Scientific Research:** HC-series VMs support a wide range of scientific computing needs, particularly in physics and chemistry, where large-scale computations and data analysis are crucial.

**Weather Forecasting and Climate Simulation:** They are used in meteorology for high-resolution weather modeling and climate simulations, which require processing large datasets and performing complex simulations.
