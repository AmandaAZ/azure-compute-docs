This section provides information on previous generations of virtual machine sizes. These sizes can still be used, but there are newer generations available.

> [!NOTE]
> Previous generation sizes **are not currently retired** and can still be used. 
> 
> These sizes will eventually be retired, so it is still recommended to migrate to the latest generation replacements as soon as possible. For more info on size series retirement, see [Size series retirement overview](./retirement_overview.md).
