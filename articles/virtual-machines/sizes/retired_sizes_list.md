VM sizes are retired over time as newer hardware takes its place. This article provides a list of all sizes which are schedule to be retired or are already retired. To learn more about size series retirement, see [Size series retirement overview](./retirement_overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Retired sizes are **no longer available** and can't be used.

> For more info on size series retirement and migrating to replacement options, see [Size series retirement overview](./retirement_overview.md).
