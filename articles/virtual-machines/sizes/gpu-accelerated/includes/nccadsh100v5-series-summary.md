The NCCads H100 v5 series Virtual Machines (VMs) are a new addition to the Azure GPU family. In this VM SKU, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) spans confidential VM on the CPU and attached GPU, enabling secure offload of data, models, and computation to the GPU.
The NCCads H100 v5 series Virtual Machines are powered by 4th-generation AMD EPYCâ„¢ Genoa processors and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. These VMs feature 1 NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs with 94GB memory, 40 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Genoa processor cores, and 320 GiB of system memory. These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as:

- GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
- Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
- Machine Learning (ML) development
- Video processing
- AI/ML web services
