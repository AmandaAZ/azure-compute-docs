The NCads H100 v5 series virtual machines (VMs) are a new addition to the Azure GPU family. You can use this series for real-world Azure Applied AI training and batch inference workloads. 
The NCads H100 v5 series virtual machines are powered by NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU and 4th-generation AMD EPYCâ„¢ Genoa processors.  The VMs feature up to 2 NVIDIA H100 NVL GPUs with 94GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Genoa processor cores and 640 GiB of system memory. 
These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as: 

- GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
- Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
- Autonomy model training
- Oil and gas reservoir simulation
- Machine learning (ML) development
- Video processing
- AI/ML web services
