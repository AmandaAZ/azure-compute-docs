Easv6-series VMs utilize AMD's 4th Generation EPYC™ 9004 processors that can achieve a boosted maximum frequency of 3.7GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 672 GiB of RAM. The Easv6-series sizes offer a combination of vCPU and memory that is ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications. The new VMs with no local disk provide a better value proposition for workloads that do not require local temporary storage.
