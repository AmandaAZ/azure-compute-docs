The FX-series runs on the Intel® Xeon® Gold 6246R (Cascade Lake) processors. It features an all-core-turbo frequency of 4.0 GHz, 21 GB RAM per vCPU, up to 1 TB total RAM, and local temporary storage. The FX-series will benefit workloads that require a high CPU clock speed and high memory to CPU ratio, workloads with high per-core licensing costs, and applications requiring a high single-core performance. A typical use case for FX-series is the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workload. FX-series VMs feature Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology, and Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512).
