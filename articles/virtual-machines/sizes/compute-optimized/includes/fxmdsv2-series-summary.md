The FXmdsv2-series Virtual Machine (VM) runs on the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8473C (Emerald Rapids) processor in a hyper threaded configuration, processor reaching an all-core turbo clock speed of up to 4.0 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU, up to 1832 GiB of RAM and up to 6x880 GiB fast, local SSD storage.  The FXmsv2-series will benefit workloads that are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications, requiring a high CPU clock speed, high memory to CPU ratio, and benefit applications requiring a high single-core performance, higher IOPs and throughput. Typical use cases for FX-series are the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and SQL workloads. 

FXmdsv2-series virtual machines support local storage. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, Premium SSDs, and Premium SSD V2 disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
