# Previous generation Azure VM sizes 

This article provides information on previous generations of virtual machine sizes.

> [!NOTE]
> Previous generation sizes **are not currently retired** and can still be used. 
> 
> These sizes will eventually be retired, so it is still recommended to migrate to the latest generation replacements as soon as possible. For more info on size series retirement, see [Size series retirement overview](./retirement_overview.md).

## List of Previous-gen sizes

### General Purpose previous-gen sizes

|Series name        |Replacement series  |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Basic A-series    | [Av2-series](../av2-series.md) |
| Standard A-series | [Av2-series](../av2-series.md) |
| Compute-intensive A-series | [HB-series](../hb-series.md) |
| D-series          | [Dav4-series](../dav4-dasv4-series.md) |

### Compute optimized previous-gen sizes

|Series name       |Replacement series  |
|------------------|--------------------|
| F-series       | [Fsv2-series](../fsv2-series.md) |
| Fs-series      | [Fsv2-series](../fsv2-series.md) |

### Memory optimized previous-gen sizes

|Series name       |Replacement series  |
|------------------|--------------------|
| GS-series        | [Easv4-series](../eav4-easv4-series.md) |
| G-series         | [Easv4-series](../eav4-easv4-series.md) |

### Storage optimized previous-gen sizes

|Series name       |Replacement series  |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Ls-series        | [Dasv4-series](../lsv2-series.md) |

For a list of retired storage optimized sizes (sizes that are no longer available for use), see [retired storage optimized sizes](./retired_sizes_list.md#storage-optimized-retired-sizes).

### GPU accelerated previous-gen sizes

Currently there are no previous-gen GPU accelerated sizes.

For a list of retired gpu accelerated sizes (sizes that are no longer available for use), see [retired gpu accelerated sizes](./retired_sizes_list.md#gpu-accelerated-retired-sizes).

### FPGA accelerated previous-gen sizes

Currently there are no previous-gen FPGA accelerated sizes.

For a list of retired FPGA accelerated sizes (sizes that are no longer available for use), see [retired fpga accelerated sizes](./retired_sizes_list.md#fpga-accelerated-retired-sizes).

### HPC previous-gen sizes

Currently there are no previous-gen HPC sizes.

For a list of retired HPC sizes (sizes that are no longer available for use), see [retired HPC sizes](./retired_sizes_list.md#hpc-retired-sizes).

### ADH previous-gen sizes

Currently there are no previous-gen ADH sizes.

For a list of retired ADH sizes (sizes that are no longer available for use), see [retired ADH sizes](./retired_sizes_list.md#adh-retired-sizes).
