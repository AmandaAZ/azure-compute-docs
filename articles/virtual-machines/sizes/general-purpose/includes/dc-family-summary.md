The 'DC' series sub-family are one of Azure's security focused general purpose VM instances. They're designed for [confidential computing](../../../../confidential-computing/overview-azure-products.md) offering enhanced data protection and integrity with various hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These VMs are ideal for handling highly sensitive data that needs isolation from the host environment. They are ideal for secure enclaves processing private data, financial transactions, and personally identifiable information (PII). This ensures a higher level of security for critical applications.
