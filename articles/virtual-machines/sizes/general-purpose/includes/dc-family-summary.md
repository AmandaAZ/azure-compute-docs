The 'DC' series family are one of Azure's security focused general purpose VM instances. They're designed for [confidential computing](/azure/confidential-computing/overview-azure-products) offering enhanced data protection and integrity with various hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These VMs are ideal for highly sensitive data, which may need more isolation from the host environment.
