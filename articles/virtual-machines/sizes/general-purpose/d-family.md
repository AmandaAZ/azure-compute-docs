# A-series Size Families

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The A-series family of VM sizes are one of Azure's general purpose VM sizes. They're designed for entry-level workloads, such as development and test environments, small to medium databases, and low-traffic web servers.

## Benefits and use cases

Cost Efficiency: A-series VMs are some of the most budget-friendly options available on Azure, making them a good choice for projects with limited financial resources or those that do not require high-performance compute capabilities.

General Workloads: They are well-suited for handling basic applications, light web servers, and small databases that do not demand extensive CPU, memory, or I/O performance.

Entry-Level Applications: These VMs can serve as a good starting point for deploying applications that are not expected to scale significantly. They provide a platform for applications and services that require less processing power.
