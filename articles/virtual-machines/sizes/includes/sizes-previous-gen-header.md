> [!NOTE]
> These virtual machine sizes are a [**previous generation series**](../previous-gen-sizes-list.md). While older VM sizes are supported until further notice, we recommended using newer generations for improved performance and security. Check out the sizes overview's [**list of VM size families by type**](../overview.md#list-of-vm-size-families-by-type) for a selection of newer sizes.
