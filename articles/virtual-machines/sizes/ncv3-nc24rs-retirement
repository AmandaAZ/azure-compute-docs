**Standard_NC24rs_v3 Retirement Guide**  

On March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2025, Microsoft Azure will retire the Standard_NC24rs_v3 virtual machine (VM) size in NCv3-series virtual machines (VMs). To avoid any disruption to your service we recommend that you change the VM sizing for your workloads from the current Standard_NC24rs_v3 to the newer VM series in the same NC product line.

Microsoft is recommending, the Azure [NC A100 v4-series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nc-a100-v4-series) VMs which offers greater GPU memory bandwidth per GPU, improved [Accelerated Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/accelerated-networking-overview?tabs=redhat) capabilities, larger and faster local solid state drives. Overall the NC A100 v4-series delivers [better cost performance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-high-performance-computing/a-quick-start-to-benchmarking-in-azure-nvidia-deep-learning/ba-p/3563884) across midrange AI training and inference workloads. 

**How does the** **retirement of the** **Standard_NC24rs_v3** **affect me?**

**After March 31st, 2025, any remaining** **Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM subscriptions will be set to a deallocated state. They'll stop working and no longer incur billing charges. The** **Standard_NC24rs_v3** **VM size** **will no longer be under SLA or have support included.**

*Note: This retirement only impacts the virtual machine sizes in the Standard_NC24rs_v3 size in* _NCv3-series powered by NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Please find_ *retirement guide for Standard_NC6s_v3, Standard_NC12s_v3, and Standard_NC24s_v3* [here](http://aka.ms/ncv3nonrdmasizemigration)_.  This retirement announcement does not apply to NCasT4 v3, and NC A100 v4 and NC H100 v5(Preview) series virtual machines._ 

**What action do I need to take before the retirement date?**

You'll need to resize or deallocate your Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM size. We recommend that you change VM sizes for these workloads, from the original Standard_NC24rs_v3 VM size to the Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4 size (or an alternative).

The Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4 VM size in [NC A100 v4 series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nc-a100-v4-series) is powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and 3rd-generation AMD EPYC™ 7V13 (Milan) processors. The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. Please check [Azure Regions by Product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/) for region availability. Visit the [Azure Virtual Machine pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/) for pricing information.

Later this year Microsoft will also be releasing the [NC H100 v5-series (currently in Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ncads-h100-v5). The NC H100 v5-Series is another SKU in the same product line powered by NVIDIA H100 NVL GPU. These VMs are targeted for GPU accelerated midrange AI training, batch inferencing, and HPC simulation workloads.  

| **Current VM Size** | **Target VM Size** | **Difference in Specification** |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard_NC24rs_v3** | Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4 | vCPU: 96 (+18)GPU Count: 4 (Same)<br>Memory: GiB 880 (+432)<br>Temp storage (SSD) GiB: 3916 (+968)<br>Max data disks: 32 (+0)<br>Accelerated networking: Yes(+)<br>Premium storage: Yes |
