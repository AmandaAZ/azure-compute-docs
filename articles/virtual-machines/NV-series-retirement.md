#Migrate your NV and NV_Promo series virtual machines by August 31st, 2022
As we continue to bring modern and optimized virtual machine instances to Azure leveraging the latest innovations in datacenter technologies, we thoughtfully plan how we retire aging hardware.
With this in mind, we are retiring our NV-series Azure Virtual Machine sizes on 1 September 2022.

#How does this affect me?  

After 1 September 2022, any remaining NV and NV_Promo size virtual machines remaining in your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These virtual machines will be stopped and removed from the host. These virtual machines will no longer be billed in the deallocated state. 

This VM size retirement only impacts the VM sizes in the [NV-series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nv-series). This does not impact the [NVv3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series) and [NVv4] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nvv4-series) series virtual machines. 

#What actions should I take?  

You will need to resize or deallocate your NV virtual machines. We recommend moving your GPU visualization/graphics workloads to another [GPU Accelerated Virtual Machine size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu).

[Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/NV-series-migration-guide) about migrating your workloads to other GPU Azure Virtual Machine sizes. 

If you have questions, please contact us. You may also reach us directly at [Azure GPU Feedback](mailto:azuregpufeedback@service.microsoft.com).
