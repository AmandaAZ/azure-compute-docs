# API Changelog + Features Updates

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

This document contains all major API changes and feature updates for the Azure Image Builder service.

## API Releases



### February 2022

(not released to public yet) 

**Improvements**: 

- Validation Support. 
- Shell (Linux) - Script or Inline. 
- PowerShell (Windows) - Script or Inline, run elevated, run as system. 
- Source-Validation-Only mode.
- Customized staging resource group support.


### October 2021

**Breaking Change**:
 
Our October 2021 API introduces a change to the error schema that will be part of every future API release. Any customer that has automated our service needs to expect to receive a new error output when switching to October 2021 or newer API versions (new schema shown below). We recommend that once customers switch to the new API version (October 2021 and beyond), they don't revert to older versions as they'll have to change their automation again to expect the older error schema. We don't anticipate changing the error schema again in future releases.

For API versions February 2020 and older, the error output will look like the following messages:

```
{ 
 "code": "ValidationFailed", 

  "message": "Validation failed: 'ImageTemplate.properties.source': Field 'imageId' has a bad value: '/subscriptions/subscriptionID/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute//images//imageName'. Please review  http://aka.ms/azvmimagebuildertmplref  for details on fields requirements in the Image Builder Template." 
} 
```


For API versions October 2021 and newer, the error output will look like the following messages:

```
{ 

  "error": { 

    "code": "ValidationFailed", 

    "message": "Validation failed: 'ImageTemplate.properties.source': Field 'imageId' has a bad value: '/subscriptions/subscriptionID/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute//images//imageName'. Please review  http://aka.ms/azvmimagebuildertmplref  for details on fields requirements in the Image Builder Template." 

  }
