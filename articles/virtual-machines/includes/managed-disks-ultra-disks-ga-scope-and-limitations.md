The following list contains Ultra Disk's limitations:
- Ultra Disks can't be used as an OS disk.
- Ultra Disks can't be used with Azure Compute Gallery.
- Currently, Ultra Disks only support Single VM and Availability zone infrastructure options.
- Ultra Disks don't support availability sets.
- The size of an Ultra Disk can't be expanded without either deallocating the VM or detaching the Ultra Disk.
- Existing disks currently can't change their type to an Ultra Disk. They must be [migrated](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-convert-types?tabs=azure-powershell#migrate-to-premium-ssd-v2-or-ultra-disk-using-snapshots).
- Currently, Azure Government and Azure China don't support [customer-managed keys](/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption#customer-managed-keys) for Ultra disks.
- Azure Disk Encryption isn't supported for VMs with Ultra Disks. Instead, you should use encryption at rest with platform-managed or customer-managed keys.
- Azure Site Recovery isn't supported for VMs with Ultra Disks.
- Ultra Disks don't support disk caching.
- Snapshots are supported with [other limitations](/azure/virtual-machines/disks-incremental-snapshots?tabs=azure-powershell#incremental-snapshots-of-premium-ssd-v2-and-ultra-disks).
- Azure Backup support for VMs with Ultra Disks is [generally available](/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix-iaas#vm-storage-support). Azure Backup has limitations when using Ultra Disks, see [VM storage support](/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix-iaas#vm-storage-support) for details.

Ultra Disks support a 4k physical sector size by default but also supports a 512E sector size. Most applications are compatible with 4k sector sizes, but some require 512-byte sector sizes. Oracle Database, for example, requires release 12.2 or later in order to support 4k native disks. For older versions of Oracle DB, 512-byte sector size is required.

The following table outlines the regions Ultra Disks are available in, and their corresponding availability options.

> [!NOTE]
> If a region in the following list lacks availability zones that support Ultra disks, then a VM in that region must be deployed without infrastructure redundancy to attach an Ultra Disk.

| Redundancy options | Regions |
|--------------------|---------|
| **Single VMs** | Australia Central<br/>Brazil South<br/>Brazil Southeast<br/>Canada East<br/>Central India<br/>East Asia<br/>Germany West Central<br/>Korea Central<br/>Korea South<br/>UK West <br/>North Central US, South Central US, West US<br/>US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, US Gov Virginia |
| **One availability zone** | UAE North |
| **Two availability zones** |  France Central <br/> Qatar Central <br/> South Africa North <br/> Switzerland North |
| **Three availability zones** | Australia East<br/>Canada Central<br/>China North 3 <br/>North Europe, West Europe<br/>Italy North<br/>Japan East<br/>Poland Central <br/>Southeast Asia<br/>Sweden Central<br/>UK South<br/>Central US, East US, East US 2, West US 2, West US 3 |

Not every VM size is available in every supported region with Ultra Disks. The following table lists VM series that are compatible with Ultra Disks.
