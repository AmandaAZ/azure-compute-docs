Explore the range of [Azure support options and choose the plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) that best fits, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications. Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal.

- If you already have an Azure Support Plan, [open a support request here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

- If you're not an Azure customer, you can open a support request with [Microsoft Support for business](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness).


## Create a GitHub issue
