# Maintenance control for Azure virtual machine scale sets 

Manage your virtual machine scale sets OS image updates, that don't require a reboot, using maintenance control. 

Maintenance control lets you decide when to apply updates to OS disks in your virtual machine scale sets through an easier and more predictable experience.

With maintenance control, you can:

- Maintenance configurations work across subscriptions and resource groups. 

The entire workflow comes down to these steps: 
- Create a maintenance configuration.
- Associate a virtual machine scale set to a maintenance configuration.
- Enable automatic OS upgrades.


## Limitations
