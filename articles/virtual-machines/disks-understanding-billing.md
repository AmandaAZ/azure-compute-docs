# Understand Azure Disks billing
Azure Disk Storage has five managed disk options: Ultra Disks, Premium solid-state drives (SSD) V2, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard hard-disk drives (HDDs). Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 are priced based on the provisioned performance and capacity that you select. Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDDs are priced based on the tier they're deployed as. All disk types are billed at an hourly rate.

This article helps you understand the factors and differences between each disk type's pricing model, and how this looks on your Azure Disks bill. We’ll also provide pricing examples for some common scenarios and show how Azure disk types compare. 

For more detailed Azure Disks pricing information, see [Azure Disks pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Factors that Affect Azure Disk Billing 
To understand Azure Disk Storage pricing, be aware of how the following criteria affects costs:

- Disk type: Each disk type has separate pricing models: Ultra Disk Storage, Premium SSD V2, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, Standard HDD.
- Disk size: Disks are charged on the total provisioned size, not actual usage. Each disk maps to a supported provisioned disk-size offering and is billed accordingly.
- Data transactions: You're billed for the number of transactions performed on a standard managed disk. (For certain disk sizes and configurations, a fee is charged per 10,000 transactions.)
- Data redundancy: Prices can change depending on the redundancy option selected: LRS, ZRS.
- Snapshots: Snapshots are a separate resource from your disks, and they're billed based on the size used and the type of storage used. So if you create a snapshot of a managed disk, you will be billed for the used size not the provisioned size of the disk.

This table displays our current disk types and the available billable features:

| Disk Category | Data Transactions | Snapshots | Bursting | Additional IOPS/Throughput |

|Premium SSD | ⛔ | ✔️ | ✔️ |⛔|
|Standard SSD|✔️| ✔️ | ✔️ |⛔|
|Standard HHD|✔️| ✔️ |⛔|⛔|

## Understanding your Azure Disks Bill  

### Provisioning examples 
The disk pricing can include various combinations of features as well as provisioned and used size. Let's take a look at some examples for different disk types and feature definitions and availability for each disk type:
For detailed Azure Disks pricing information, see [Azure Disks pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

### Standard Disks:
- Standard HDDs: Azure standard HDDs deliver reliable, low-cost disk support for VMs running latency-tolerant workloads. 
- Standard SSDs: Azure standard SSDs are optimized for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels.

#### Standard HDD Transactions
For Standard HDDs, each I/O operation is considered as a single transaction, whatever the I/O size. These transactions have a billing impact.

#### Standard SSD transactions
For standard SSDs, each I/O operation less than or equal to 256 kB of throughput is considered a single I/O operation. I/O operations larger than 256 kB of throughput are considered multiple I/Os of size 256 kB. These transactions incur a billable cost but, there's an hourly limit on the number of transactions that can incur a billable cost. If that hourly limit is reached, additional transactions during that hour no longer incur a cost. For details, see the blog post.

#### Standard SSD Bursting
Standard SSDs offer disk bursting, which provides better tolerance for the unpredictable IO pattern changes. OS boot disks and applications prone to traffic spikes will both benefit from disk bursting. To learn more about how bursting for Azure disks works, see Disk-level bursting.

#### Snapshots
Full snapshots and images are charged at a monthly rate for both LRS and ZRS snapshot options based on the used portion of the disk. For example, if you create a snapshot of a managed disk with provisioned capacity of 64 GB and actual used data size of 10 GB, snapshot will be billed only for the used data size of 10 GB.

Incremental snapshots for Standard HDDs also incur a monthly charge for both LRS and ZRS snapshot options based on the storage occupied by the delta changes since the last snapshot. 

#### Example 1 - Standard HDD 
In this example, we provision a 512 Gb Standard HDD Disk with LRS redundancy. 
You will be billed for the provisioned size of the HDD disk and the transactions performed on the disk, which will show as the following tier and meters in your bill:

| Tier | Meter |
|-|-|
|Standard HDD Managed Disks| S20 LRS Disk|
|Standard HDD Managed Disks| S4 LRS Disk Operations|

#### Example 2 - Standard SSD 
In this example, we provision a 1 Tb Standard SSD Disk with LRS redundancy, where we also have snapshot created on the current used data size of 120 Gb. 
You will be billed for the provisioned size of the HDD disk, the transactions performed on the disk, and the used snapshot size which will show as the following tier and meters in your bill:

| Tier | Meter |
|-|-|
|Standard SSD Managed Disks| E30 LRS Disk|
|Standard SSD Managed Disks| E4 LRS Disk Operations|
|Standard SSD Managed Disks| E10 LRS Disk |

### Premium Storage:
- Premium SSDs: Azure Premium SSDs deliver high-performance and low-latency disk support for virtual machines (VMs) with input/output (IO)-intensive workloads. 
- Premium SSD v2: Premium SSD v2 disks, you can individually set the capacity, throughput, and IOPS of a disk based on your workload needs, providing you with more flexibility and reduced costs
- Ultra SSDs: Ultra disks feature a flexible performance configuration model that allows you to independently configure IOPS and throughput both before and after you provision the disk.

#### Premium SSD bursting
Premium SSD managed disks offer [on-demand disk bursting](disks-enable-bursting.md), providing better tolerance on unpredictable changes of IO patterns. Disk bursting is especially useful during OS disk boot and for applications with spiky traffic. 
Premium SSD managed disks using the on-demand bursting model are charged an hourly burst enablement flat fee and transaction costs apply to any burst transactions beyond the provisioned target. Transaction costs are charged using the pay-as-you go model, based on uncached disk IOs, including both reads and writes that exceed provisioned targets. 

#### Premium SSD transactions
For Premium SSD managed disks, each I/O operation less than or equal to 256 kB of throughput is considered a single I/O operation. I/O operations larger than 256 kB of throughput are considered multiple I/Os of size 256 kB.

#### Premium SSD v2 IOPS
All Premium SSD v2 disks have a baseline IOPS of 3000 that is free of charge. After 6 GiB, the maximum IOPS a disk can have increases at a rate of 500 per GiB, up to 80,000 IOPS. So an 8 GiB disk can have up to 4,000 IOPS, and a 10 GiB can have up to 5,000 IOPS. To be able to set 80,000 IOPS on a disk, that disk must have at least 160 GiBs. Increasing your IOPS beyond 3000 increases the price of your disk.

#### Premium SSD v2 throughput
All Premium SSD v2 disks have a baseline throughput of 125 MB/s that is free of charge. After 6 GiB, the maximum throughput that can be set increases by 0.25 MB/s per set IOPS. If a disk has 3,000 IOPS, the max throughput it can set is 750 MB/s. To raise the throughput for this disk beyond 750 MB/s, its IOPS must be increased. Increasing your throughput beyond 125 increases the price of your disk.

#### Snapshots
You can store incremental snapshots for Premium SSD and Premium SSD v2 only on Standard storage (which will also be reflected on the bill, see below examples). They are charged a monthly rate for both Standard LRS and ZRS snapshot options of the storage occupied by the delta changes since the last snapshot. For example, you are using a managed disk with provisioned size of 128 GiB and a used size of 10 GiB. The first incremental snapshot is billed only for the used size of 10 GiB. Before you create the second snapshot, 20 GiB of data is added to the disk. Now, the second incremental snapshot is billed for only 20 GiB.

#### Example 1 - Premium SSD 
In this example, we want to provision a Premium SSD Disk at 512 GiB with LRS redundancy with bursting enabled.
You are billed for the provisioned size of the Premium SSD disk and the burst enablement flat fee and transaction costs apply to any burst transactions beyond the provisioned target which will show as the following tier and meters in your bill:

| Tier | Meter |
|-|-|
|Premium SSD Managed Disks| P20 LRS Disk|
|Premium SSD Managed Disks| LRS Burst Enablement* |

*To see a more detailed example of how bursting is billed, see [Disk-level bursting](disk-bursting.md#disk-level-bursting).

#### Example 2 - Premium SSD v2 
In this example, we want to provision a Premium SSD v2 Disk with LRS redundancy with a total provisioned size of 512 GiB, a target performance of 40,000 IOPS and 200 MB/s of throughput. You also create and store incremental snapshots for your current used capacity. 
You will be billed for the provisioned size of the disk, the additional IOPS and throughput past the baseline values, and the used snapshot size which will show as the following tier and meters in your bill:

| Tier | Meter |
|-|-|
|Azure Premium SSD v2| Premium LRS provisioned capacity|
|Azure Premium SSD v2| Premium LRS provisioned IOPS |
|Azure Premium SSD v2| Premium LRS provisioned throughput (MB/s) |
|Standard HDD managed disks| LRS snapshots |

### Ultra Disks:
- Ultra SSDs: Ultra Disks feature a flexible performance configuration model that allows you to independently configure IOPS and throughput both before and after you provision the disk.

#### Ultra disk IOPS
Ultra disks support IOPS limits of 300 IOPS/GiB, up to a maximum of 160,000 IOPS per disk. To achieve the target IOPS for the disk, ensure that the selected disk IOPS are less than the VM IOPS limit.

The current maximum limit for IOPS for a single VM in generally available sizes is 80,000. Ultra disks with greater IOPS can be used as shared disks to support multiple VMs.

The minimum guaranteed IOPS per disk are 1 IOPS/GiB, with an overall baseline minimum of 100 IOPS. For example, if you provisioned a 4-GiB ultra disk, the minimum IOPS for that disk is 100, instead of four.


#### Ultra disk throughput
The throughput limit of a single ultra disk is 256-kB/s for each provisioned IOPS, up to a maximum of 4000 MB/s per disk (where MB/s = 10^6 Bytes per second). The minimum guaranteed throughput per disk is 4kB/s for each provisioned IOPS, with an overall baseline minimum of 1 MB/s.

You can adjust ultra disk IOPS and throughput performance at runtime without detaching the disk from the virtual machine. After a performance resize operation has been issued on a disk, it can take up to an hour for the change to take effect. Up to four performance resize operations are permitted during a 24-hour window.

#### Snapshots
You can store incremental snapshots for Ultra Disk only on Standard storage (which will also be reflected on the bill, see below examples). They are charged a monthly rate for both Standard LRS and ZRS snapshot options of the storage occupied by the delta changes since the last snapshot. For example, you are using a managed disk with provisioned size of 128 GB and a used size of 10 GB. The first incremental snapshot is billed only for the used size of 10 GB. Before you create the second snapshot, 20 GB of data is added to the disk. Now, the second incremental snapshot is billed for only 20 GB.

#### Example 1 - Ultra Disk 
In this example, we want to provision an Ultra Disk with ZRS redundancy with a total provisioned size of 3 Tb, a target performance of 100,000 IOPS and 2,000 MB/s of throughput. You also create and store incremental snapshots for your current used capacity. 
You will be billed for the provisioned size of the disk, the additional IOPS and throughput past the baseline values, and the used snapshot size which will show as the following tier and meters in your bill:

| Tier | Meter |
|-|-|
|Ultra Disks| Ultra ZRS provisioned capacity|
|Ultra Disks| Ultra ZRS provisioned IOPS |
|Ultra Disks| Ultra ZRS provisioned throughput (MB/s) |
|Standard HDD managed disks| ZRS snapshots |
