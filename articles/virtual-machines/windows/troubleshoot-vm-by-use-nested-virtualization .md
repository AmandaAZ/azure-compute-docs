# How to troubleshoot a problem Azure VM by using nested virtualization in Azure

This article shows how to create a nested environment in Microsoft Azure, so you can mount the VHD of the problem VM on the Hyper-V Host (Recovery VM) for troubleshooting purpose.

## Prerequisite

To mount the problem VM, the Recovery VM must meet the following prerequisite:

-   The Recovery VM must be in the same location as the problem VM.

-   The Recovery VM must be in the same resource group as the problem VM.

-   The Recovery VM must use the same type of Storage Account (Standard or Premium) as the problem VM.

## Step 1 Create a recovery VM and install Hyper-V role

1.  Create a new Recovery VM:

    -  OS: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter

    -  Size: Any V3 series with at least two cores

    -  Same Location, Storage Account, and Resource Group as the problem VM.

    -  Select the same storage type as the problem VM (Standard or Premium)

2.  After the Recovery VM is created, remote desktop to the Recovery VM.

3.  In Server Manager, select **Manage** > **Add Roles and Features**.

4.  In the **Installation Type** section, select **Role-based or feature-based installation**.

5.  In the **select destination server** section, make sure that the Recovery VM is selected.

6.  Select the **Hyper-V role**.

7.  Select **Next** on the **Features** section.

8.  If a virtual switch is available, select it. Otherwise select **Next**.

9.  On the **Migration** section, select **Next**

10. On the **Default Stores** section, select **Next**.

11. Check the box to restart the server automatically if required.

12. Select **Install**.

13. Allow the server to install the Hyper-V role. This will take a few minutes and the server will reboot automatically.

## Step 2 Create the problem VM on the recovery VM’s Hyper-V server

1.  Delete the problem VM. Make sure that you keep all attached disks

2.  Attach the OS disk of your problem machine as a data disk of the Recovery VM (Azure Host VM).

    1.  Once the problem VM is deleted, go to the Recovery VM.

    2.  Select **Disks** and then **Attach Existing**.

    3.  Browse to the location of the problem VM’s VHD.

    4.  Select the problem VMs VHD and click **OK**.

3.  Once the disk has successfully attached, remote desktop to the Recovery VM.

4.  Open Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc), make sure that the VHD of the problem VM is set to **Offline**

5.  In Server Manager, select the **Hyper-V role**. Right click on the server and select the **Hyper-V Manger**.

6.  In the Hyper-V manager, right-click the Recovery VM and select **New** > **Virtual Machine** > **Next**.

7.  Type a name the Virtual Machine and select **Next**

8.  Select **Generation 1**.

9.  Set the startup memory at 1024 MB or more.

10. If applicable select the Hyper-V Network Switch that was created. Else move to the next page.

11. Select **Attach a Virtual Hard Disk Later**.

12. Select **Finish** when the VM is created.

13. Right click on the VM that we just created and select **Settings**.

14. Select **IDE Controller 0**, select **Hard Drive**, and then click **Add**.

15. In **Physical Hard Disk**, select the VHD of the problem VM we attached to the Azure VM.

16. If you do not see any disks listed. Double check if the VHD is set to Online by using Disk management.

17. Select **Apply** and **OK.**

18. Double-click on the VM and Start it

19. At this point, you can work on your VM as the On-Premises VM. You could follow any troubleshooting steps you need.

## Step 3 Recreate your Azure VM in Azure

1.  Once you get the VM back online shutdown the nested VM in the Hyper-V manager.

2.  Go back to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the Recovery VM and then Disks.

3.  Detach the Fixed VHD from the recovery VM.

4.  [Create a VM from the
    VHD](create-vm-specialized.md#create-the-new-vm).

## New steps

If you are having issues connecting to your VM, see [Troubleshoot RDP connections to an Azure VM](troubleshoot-rdp-connection.md). For issues with accessing applications running on your VM, see [Troubleshoot application connectivity issues on a Windows VM](troubleshoot-app-connection.md).
