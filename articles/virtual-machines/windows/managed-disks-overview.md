# Azure Managed Disks Overview

An Azure managed disk is a VHD (virtual hard disk). You can think of it like a physical disk like disks in an on-premises server but, virtualized.

You can select the type and size of the managed disks that you require, Azure then creates and manages the disk for you. The available types are Ultra SSD (Preview) , Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD. You can learn more about each individual disk type in the [disk-types](disks-types.md) article.
