title: Enable double encryption at rest - managed disks
description: Azure Storage protects your data by encrypting it at rest before persisting it to Storage clusters. You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your managed disks, or you can use customer-managed keys to manage encryption with your own keys.

# Azure PowerShell - Enable double encryption at rest on your managed disks

Azure Disk Storage supports double encryption at rest for managed disks. For conceptual information on double encryption at rest, as well as other managed disk encryption types, see the [Double encryption at rest](disk-encryption.md#double-encryption-at-rest) section of our disk encryption article.

## Supported regions

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-regions](../../../includes/virtual-machines-disks-double-encryption-at-rest-regions.md)]

## Prerequisites

Install the latest [Azure PowerShell version](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps), and sign in to an Azure account using [Connect-AzAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount?view=azps-4.3.0).

## Getting started

1. Create an instance of Azure Key Vault and encryption key.

    When creating the Key Vault instance, you must enable soft delete and purge protection. Soft delete ensures that the Key Vault holds a deleted key for a given retention period (90 day default). Purge protection ensures that a deleted key cannot be permanently deleted until the retention period lapses. These settings protect you from losing data due to accidental deletion. These settings are mandatory when using a Key Vault for encrypting managed disks.
    
    ```powershell
    $ResourceGroupName="yourResourceGroupName"
    $LocationName="westcentralus"
    $keyVaultName="yourKeyVaultName"
    $keyName="yourKeyName"
    $keyDestination="Software"
    $diskEncryptionSetName="yourDiskEncryptionSetName"

    $keyVault = New-AzKeyVault -Name $keyVaultName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Location $LocationName -EnableSoftDelete -EnablePurgeProtection

    $key = Add-AzKeyVaultKey -VaultName $keyVaultName -Name $keyName -Destination $keyDestination  
    ```

1. Create an instance of a DiskEncryptionSet. 
    
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName CMKTesting `
    -TemplateUri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramankumarlive/manageddisksdoubleencryptionpreview/master/CreateDiskEncryptionSetForDoubleEncryption.json" `
    -diskEncryptionSetName "yourDESForDoubleEncryption" `
    -keyVaultId "subscriptions/dd80b94e-0463-4a65-8d04-c94f403879dc/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/yourKeyVaultName" `
    -keyVaultKeyUrl "https://yourKeyVaultName.vault.azure.net/keys/yourKeyName/403445136dee4a57af7068cab08f7d42" `
    -encryptionType "EncryptionAtRestWithPlatformAndCustomerKeys" `
    -region "CentralUSEUAP"
    ```

1. Grant the DiskEncryptionSet resource access to the key vault.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take few minutes for Azure to create the identity of your DiskEncryptionSet in your Azure Active Directory. If you get an error like "Cannot find the Active Directory object" when running the following command, wait a few minutes and try again.

```powershell  
Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $keyVaultName -ObjectId $des.Identity.PrincipalId -PermissionsToKeys wrapkey,unwrapkey,get
```
