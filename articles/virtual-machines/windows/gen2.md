# Generation 2 VMs (preview) in Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generation 2 VMs are currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Support for generation 2 virtual machines (VMs) is now available in public preview on Azure. Now, you can upload a generation 2 Windows virtual machines (VM) from on-premises to Azure.

Generation 2 VMs support key features like: increased memory, IntelÂ® Software Guard Extensions (SGX), and virtual persistent memory (vPMEM), which are not supported on generation 1 VMs. Compared to generation 1 VMs, generation 2 VMs may have improved boot and installation times.

For public preview, custom image generation 2 VMs cannot be created in the Azure portal. Instead, create a custom image generation 2 VM using [PowerShell](quick-create-powershell.md). The Portal can be used to create a generation 2 VM from an Azure Marketplace image. See the [capabilities](#generation-1-vs-generation-2-vm-capabilities) section for a list of supported marketplace images.

All VM sizes in Azure currently support Generation 1 VMs. Azure now offers Generation 2 support for the following selected VM series in public preview:

* [Dsv2](/sizes-general.md#dsv2-series) and [Dsv3-series](/sizes-general.md#dsv3-series-1)
* [Esv3-series](/sizes-memory.md#esv3-series)
* [Fsv2-series](/sizes-compute.md#fsv2-series-1)
* [GS-series](/sizes-memory.md#gs-series)
* [Ls-series](/sizes-storage.md#ls-series) and [Lsv2-series](/sizes-storage.md#lsv2-series)

Generation 2 VMs support UEFI BIOS configurations. UEFI provides support for features like:

* GPT disks, which enables OS disks up to 2 TB.
* Up to 12 TB of memory.

But, Azure does not currently support some of the features that on-premises Hyper-V supports for Generation 2 VMs. 

| Generation 2 feature                | On-premises Hyper-V | Azure |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Secure Boot                         | Y                   | N     |
| Shielded VM                         | Y                   | N     |
| vTPM                                | Y                   | N     |
| Virtualization Based Security (VBS) | Y                   | N     |
