# Azure Security Baseline for Windows Virtual Machines

The Azure Security Baseline for Windows Virtual Machines contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1816).

**Guidance**: When you create an Azure virtual machine (VM), you must create a virtual network (VNet) or use an existing VNet and configure VM with a subnet.   Ensure that all deployed subnets have a Network Security Group applied with network access controls specific to your applications trusted ports and sources. Use Azure Services with Private Link enabled, deploy the service inside your VNet or connect privately using Private Endpoints. For service specific requirements, please refer to the security recommendation for that specific service.  Alternatively, if customer has a specific use case, Azure Firewall may also be used to meet certain requirements.

**Guidance**: Use Azure Network Security group to configure which network traffic and ports are able to connect to the resources on the Virtual Network.  NSGs contain two sets of rules: inbound and outbound. The priority for a rule must be unique within each set. Each rule has properties of protocol, source and destination port ranges, address prefixes, direction of traffic, priority, and access type.

Using Azure Security Center Integrated Threat Intelligence, you can deny communications with known malicious IP addresses.  Configure appropriately Azure Firewall on each of the Virtual Network segments, with Threat Intelligence enabled and configured to "Alert and deny" for malicious network traffic.

You can use Azure Security Center's Just In Time Network access to limit exposure of Windows Virtual Machines to the approved IP addresses for a limited period.  Also, use Azure Security Center Adaptive Network Hardening to recommend NSG configurations that limit ports and source IPs based on actual traffic and threat intelligence.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1823).

**Guidance**: Use Virtual Network Service Tags to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall configured for your Azure Virtual machines. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Guidance**: There are several options for maintaining a secure configuration for Azure Virtual Machines(VM) for deployment:
1- Azure Resource Manager templates: These are JSON based files used to deploy a VM from the Azure Portal, and custom template will need to be maintained. Microsoft performs the maintenance on the base templates.

2- Custom Virtual hard disk (VHD): In some circumstances it may be required to have custom VHD files used such as when dealing with complex environments that cannot be managed through other means. 

3- Azure Automation State Configuration: Once the base OS is deployed, this can be used for more granular control of the settings, and enforced through the automation framework.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1897).

**Guidance**: When you back up Azure managed disks with Azure Backup, VMs are encrypted at rest with Storage Service Encryption (SSE). Azure Backup can also back up Azure VMs that are encrypted by using Azure Disk Encryption.  Azure Disk Encryption integrates with BitLocker encryption keys (BEKs), which are safeguarded in a key vault as secrets. Azure Disk Encryption also integrates with Azure Key Vault key encryption keys (KEKs). Enable Soft-Delete in Key Vault to protect keys against accidental or malicious deletion.

## Incident Response

*For more information, see [Security Control: Incident Response](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-incident-response).*

### 10.1: Create incident response guide

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1899).

**Guidance**: Build out an incident response guide for your organization. Ensure that there are written incident response plans that define all roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management from detection to post-incident review.

### 10.2: Create Incident Scoring and Prioritization Procedure

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1900).

**Guidance**: Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytic used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert. 
	

	Additionally, clearly mark subscriptions (for ex. production, non-prod) using tags and create a naming system to clearly identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data.  It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.

	

	Security alerts in Azure Security Center: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-alerts-overview
