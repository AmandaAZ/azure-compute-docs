# Enable end-to-end encryption (preview)

Azure Disk Storage offers end-to-end encryption (preview) for managed disks, allowing you to have double encryption at rest and in transit. For conceptual information on end-to-end encryption, as well as other managed disk encryption types, see [Server-side encryption of Azure managed disks](disk-encryption.md#end-to-end-encryption)
