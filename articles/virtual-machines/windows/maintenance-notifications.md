## View maintenance notifications for Windows virtual machines

You can use the Azure portal, API, PowerShell, or CLI to query for the
maintenance windows for your VMs. In addition, expect to
receive a notification (email) in the case where one (or more) of your
VMs are impacted during the process.

Both pre-emptive maintenance and scheduled maintenance phases begin with
a notification. Expect to receive a single notification per Azure
subscription. The notification is sent to the subscriptionâ€™s admin
and co-admin by default. You can also configure the audience for the
maintenance notification.

### View the Maintenance Window in the portal 

You can use the Azure portal and look for VMs scheduled for maintenance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the left navigation, click **Virtual Machines**.

3. In the Virtual Machines pane, click the **Columns** button to open the list of available columns.

4. Select and add the **Maintenance Window** columns. VMs that are scheduled for maintenance have the maintenance windows surfaced. Once maintenance is completed or aborted, the maintenance window is no longer be presented.

### Query maintenance details using the Azure API

Use the [get VM information
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/virtualmachines-get)
and look for the instance view to discover the maintenance details on an
individual VM. The response includes the following elements:

  - isCustomerInitiatedMaintenanceAllowed: Indicates whether you can now initiate pre-emptive redeploy on the VM.

  - preMaintenanceWindowStartTime: The start time of the pre-emptive maintenance window.

  - preMaintenanceWindowEndTime: The end time of the pre-emptive maintenance window. After this time, you will no longer be able to initiate maintenance on this VM.
    
  - maintenanceWindowStartTime: The start time of the scheduled maintenance window when your VM are impacted.

  - maintenanceWindowEndTime: The end time of the scheduled maintenance window.
  
  - lastOperationResultCode: The result of your last Maintenance-Redeploy operation.
 
  - lastOperationMessage:  Message describing the result of your last Maintenance-Redeploy operation.
